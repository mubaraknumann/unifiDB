[{"igdb_id":221860,"name":"Fhtagn Simulator","summary":"Fhtagn Simulator is a Roguelike card game inspired by deck-building games such as Luck be a Landlord, Slay the Spire, and Monster Train. If you don't collect enough spirit within the time limit, you will face punishment from the ancient gods resulting in game failure.\n\nThe world of Cthulhu is chaotic and disorderly, so cards always enter the roulette in a chaotic order, and each round may produce a different result. Except praying, there is one way to fight against Chaos, and that is to manage the card slots on the roulette. With a little change, you can maximize value of your cards.\n\nDuring the course of the game you will experience various events, as well as obtain various cards, powerful mythical monsters, humble human sacrifices, evil spells and so on. In addition to this, relics rewarded by the evil gods have the ability to change the game. Use them well to get more spirit!","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Indie","Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":["INDIECN"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1666310400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5jb4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":271229,"name":"Fhtagn Nagh","summary":"Large tower temple map \"built entirely on the 64-unit grid.

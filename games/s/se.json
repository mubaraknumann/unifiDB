Released in August 1991, the game followed the campaign by the US 8th Air Force to cripple the German Luftwaffe during the final years of World War II. Players could fly in either American or German warplanes. The game was remarkable because many of the playable airplanes were still under development during the war. In other words, the planes were never used extensively in battle, so players could explore “what if ” possibilities with the game. Those possibilities were further expanded by four Tour of Duty expansion packs. The planes in those expansions included the P-38 Lighting, a twin-engine escort fighter and the German Do335, an interceptor aircraft that featured a conventional tractor propeller in the nose as well as a pusher propeller behind the tail of the aircraft.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Lucasfilm Games"],"publishers":["Lucasfilm Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":681004800,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21h6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":527,"name":"Serious Sam 3: BFE","summary":"Serious Sam 3: BFE is a first-person action shooter, a glorious throwback to the golden age of first-person shooters where men were men, cover was for amateurs and pulling the trigger made things go boom.\n\nServing as a prequel to the original game, Serious Sam: The First Encounter, Serious Sam 3 takes place during the Earth’s final struggle against Mental’s invading legions of beasts and mercenaries.","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Croteam"],"publishers":["Devolver Digital"],"aggregated_rating":70.83333333333333,"release_date":1321920000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2hd4.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"41070","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/41070"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"23904","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Serious Sam 3: BFE"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"26445","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-26445/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025841127f","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025841127f"}]},{"igdb_id":787,"name":"Serious Sam II","summary":"The iconic Serious Sam brings his trademark relentless intensity to this bigger, bolder, more colorful sequel to the classic Serious Sam: First and Second Encounters!

Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don't give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples).\n\nMissions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield.\n\nUnusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement.

At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow.

Symptoms such as anxiety, increased heart rate and shivering will occur. This game is not for the sensitive type, but for those who are willing to explore the facets of fear!       \n       \nTHE LEGEND       \nThe Wendigo is a savage predator that craves human flesh and prefers to eats its victims alive. It's cursed to roam the tribal grounds of North America and is part of the traditional belief system of a number of Algonquin-speaking peoples. Although we don't know where it came from and descriptions can vary, one thing is certain: it is evil, cannibalistic, has an unending hunger and won't be satisfied after killing and consuming one victim.       \n       \nThis creature is intelligent, agile, possesses supernatural strength, has enhanced senses and excels in stealth. The combination of these abilities allows it to stalk its victims without being noticed and once it has you in sight it's probably already too late.       \n       \nCONTROLS       \nFor the best experience we advise to play Seeking Evil while standing. In the case that you prefer to play it while seated it’s strongly recommended to use a non-vr controller or the good old keyboard and mouse set-up.         \n       \nControls for keyboard and non-vr controllers are really straight-forward, but how will Seeking Evil: The Wendigo be played in VR? Let’s have a look:       \n       \nTo ensure a more immersive experience Seeking Evil doesn't rely on a point teleportation system for locomotion and the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller are used.       \n       \nIn order to sprint you can press the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller. There will also be situations where you’re chased by the Wendigo, here shaking the vr controllers as if you were running will allow you to increase your speed even more which might be a matter of life or death.       \n       \nSince using stealth is important to succeed in burning all the totems; sometimes ducking will be advised to hide from the Wendigo.        \n       \nFinally there are also a couple handheld items which can be easily picked up by aiming your hand towards an item which will then snap to your hand. Once an item is picked up it can be mounted on your belt for later use.       \n       \nGAMEPLAY       \nYou'll find yourself stranded in the creepy forests of North America. Things might seem peaceful, but don't be fooled as these grounds are cursed. To break the curse you'll need to find and burn nine totems. That's only the beginning since these haunted forests are home to a legendary creature called The Wendigo. This bloodthirsty predator is fast, smart, has great senses and will do everything it can to eat you alive.        \n       \nYou'll have to combine stealth with tactical timing to outsmart the Wendigo. Oh, and when it attacks, don't be a hero ... just RUN!\"","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Copybugpaste"],"publishers":["Copybugpaste"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1505088000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co24s0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":28151,"name":"Segagaga","summary":"One of Sega's final titles for the Dreamcast, Segagaga is a genre-defying experience where Sega pokes fun at themselves which was given a release outside of Japan.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator"],"developers":["Sega AM3"],"publishers":["Sega Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":985824000,"platforms":["Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6yxb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":28232,"name":"Sea Dogs: To Each His Own","summary":"1654 AC.

According to Dave, Sewermania was MB President Jim Shea's favorite game out of all the MBX titles that were in development.\n\nAccording to early promotional material, the generator located in the upper left corner of the screen was intended to flood the sewer and kill all the rats. This would help the player in locating the bomb since there would be no rats to avoid for a few seconds (although the alligator would still be lurking around). In the released version of the game, however, the generator's functionality was removed making it impossible to flood the sewer. According to programmer Dave Landon the reason for the removal was because the game was initially developed for MB's own video game unit before being brought over the TI-99/4A (read the MBX development history by clicking the link in the above Trivia section). The TI-99/4A's cartridges were smaller in size apparently to what Milton Bradley had envisioned for its own system, so to meet memory constraints the functionality of the generators had to be removed.\n\nThis game can be used with Milton Bradley's MBX System (an add-on for the TI-99/4A). The MBX allowed for the use of Voice Recognition, improved Speech Synthesis, a 360° Analog Joystick, and an Action-Input Keypad for video games designed for it.\n\nEaster Egg Alert! At the beginning of the game the phrase \"Dave, find the bomb\" is spoken aloud by the MBX system or the Speech Synthesizer (depending on if you have an MBX system or not).

This objective is similar to other video games in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Yet, it is also different in the sense that instead of a typical platforming game, the game is centered entirely around running as fast as possible on a linear course from a never-ending barrage of threats, including giant boulders, lava flows, rogue gears, falling stalactites, and other traps. When the player is hit by a dangerous obstacle or hazard, they lose health from the Health Gauge, which can be refilled by collecting Rings that found around the arena. Upon completing each level, the game tallies up how many Rings were grabbed. Extra points are also received if over half of the level's Rings were found.\n\nThe game only has a few enemies and one boss that appears midway through the game.

The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) says \"So, what's better about Set Pro HD than either the earlier Set app or a deck of Set cards. Well, pretty much everything.....\". See /.\n\nThe SET game has won over 35 Best Game Awards. SET Pro HD enables you to find SETs at the speed of your brain. Using two hands you have the same speed advantage as you do in typing or playing the piano. The sense of a really fast player is, in fact, that of a piano player (see the YouTube demo -  – boy does this guy have good brain connections!). The SET game is also enjoyed when played with others. In multi-player game play there are no turns in the game. Up to four people can simultaneously play all using both hands. SET Pro HD removes all previous electronic limitations in all of its play modes, making this realization of the SET game a joy to play.\n\nTo find a SET you must recognize three cards on the gameboard of 12 cards in which each of the features, examined independently, are either the same on the 3 cards OR different on the 3 cards. That’s it. One rule. It is deceptively simple. Thus, it’s easy to learn. A 6 year old can do it. But it’s a challenge for life, and mastering it challenges college students and their professors. The game has two levels Basic and Advanced. All players, regardless of age need to learn using the Basic level. Once you get the idea down, move to the Advanced level where you will experience the depth and richness of the mental challenge of SET. The Advanced level is the complete SET game. Of course, since SET is a game for all ages, younger players may take longer to be able to play the full game. Basic level has 3 features that anyone can master. Advanced level has four features, which is a challenge for all.\n\nWhen you want a challenge for just yourself, SET Pro HD includes 6 solitaire game modes, Classical SET, Rediscovery SET, Sprint SET, Marathon SET, Puzzle SET, and Arcade SET. In Classical SET play, SET Pro HD challenges you to get through the deck in the shortest time finding SETs. In Rediscovery SET you try to get 25 SETs in the shortest time, with the cards either being rearranged, or, with 3 cards randomly replaced every 10 seconds if you don’t find a SET. In Sprint SET you are challenged to get the most SETs in 60 or 90 seconds. You never run out of cards. In Marathon SET you must pace yourself to get the best scores. Puzzle SET challenges you to find 4 or 6 SETs in a fixed gameboard of cards. Arcade SET paces you as you play requiring you to find SETs faster and faster until you cry ‘uncle’. In all game modes you can play either Basic or Advanced Level.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, players tap their scorecards to take control of the board, and then tap-in their SET, or, after tapping they can swipe their scorecard (or tap the NO-SET icon) to gain additional points if they perceive that a NO-SET situation exists. A point is lost if 3 cards are selected that don’t make a SET, or if a player doesn’t tap the cards within the time limit.\n\nFor beginners, there is an interactive Tutorial, and Hints are provided in all the game modes. Players can choose to play in teams. Your scores can be kept in the STATS if you choose, and in STATS ALL your best scores and those of all your friends are ranked if players want to see their rankings.\n\nAdditional help and Tutorials are provided on the website","genres":["Puzzle","Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1279152000,"platforms":["iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/atmeifb6fidegdzideaa.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":87681,"name":"Secret Kingdom Defenders","summary":"\"A classic Chinese tale comes to life in this fresh take on the classic hero defense game.

When this occurs, a \"Shoot\" prompt appears on screen, telling the player to shoot the target objects marked with red circles. If the player succeeds, 1000 pts. are awarded and enemy attacks are avoided.\n\nIf the player fails, he/she will have to battle many enemies or take damage. If there are two players, they may earn extra points by performing \"co-op shots\" on enemies. At the end of each level is a unique boss - a possessed god from traditional Chinese culture. Their weak points are revealed in the form of on-screen prompts before the boss battle begins.

At the start of the level you choose a starting point, the intention being to get lots of flat land as well as resources to mine and ideally existing sources of trees, stones and water (for fish). Your people are vying for supremacy with up to 3 others.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on resource management. Each building requires a certain amount of wood (and stones for some of them) to be constructed and requires particular resources to perform its function successfully. Food must be produced (either fish, bread (requiring a windmill, grain-farmer and baker) or pork (requiring a pig-farmer and butcher as well as the grain-farm) to feed the people working in mines to produce the iron, coal and gold (as well as additional stones).\n\nHuts and Watch-Towers are built to expand your territory, sometimes at the expense of an enemy's land (clever play involves targeting an area where your opponent has a crucial building, thus compromising his production).\n\nTo finally win the level, you must defeat your opponents. Combat is fought one-at-a-time by the little soldiers and a victory results in all surrounding buildings being lost.\n\nThe game features 30 preset missions. 6 tutorials missions will help beginners to learn the game mechanics. The game also offers the possibility to play semi-randomly (based on a 16-number key) generated maps. The map size varies from small maps, for quick matches, to large maps to, depending on how much RAM is available, huge maps, for very long matches as the fact that the in-game statistics can be displayed on a 50-hour scale illustrates. These semi-random maps can be played in single-player mode but can also be played by 2 players on one system, if you have 2 mice, in which case the screen is vertically split.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Blue Byte Software"],"publishers":["Blue Byte Software","SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)"],"aggregated_rating":10.0,"release_date":741398400,"platforms":["DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4v92.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":124758,"name":"Sesshouseki - Malice Eater","summary":null,"genres":["Shooter","Indie"],"developers":["Project Noise"],"publishers":["Amusement Makers"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6z07.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":124778,"name":"Sengoku Jidai Gold","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ce9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":124991,"name":"Set Sail: Caribbean","summary":"Hard times have come for the good-willed Caribbean governor, Sir Francis, as the creditors are knocking on his door.

It is part of the Wave Jack series of games produced by Imagineer that come with more accessories than the average video game, including a story book and audio cassette tape.\n\nSeiken Psycho Calibur is, in many ways, an attempt to copy the success of The Legend of Zelda. However, it fails to inspire the same level of wonder and fascination. It also lacks a good degree of polish that made the afore mentioned title so great. Nevertheless, Seiken Psycho Calibur is a relatively fun game to play, as long as you have a fair degree of insight into how the game is played. There are some unintuitive aspects of the game that can make progress in the game quite difficult.\n\nFor example, you begin the game in a town which offers a variety of goods for sale, but you only receive so much money, and you can never return to the town once you leave. Therefore, what you decide to invest your money in has a substantial impact on the difficulty of the game early on. Many items can be bought for less money later on, but only if you know the location of the hidden shops that contain them. Other less obvious points in the game require a bit of back tracking from later areas to earlier areas in order to acquire items that allow you to proceed, and boss battles that are at times incredibly difficult.\n\nThis game was fan-translated into English by a user name Toma, who released the patch on December 20, 2000.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["C-Lab"],"publishers":["Imagineer"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":548380800,"platforms":["Family Computer Disk System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yw7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146537,"name":"Seraphim: Master of Legend","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yzf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146580,"name":"Seek and Find Collection 1","summary":"In Seek & Find Collection 1 there are a bunch of images to search the 7 differences before the time is up.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":["SelectSoft Publishing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1293753600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8hvi.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1499495633","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Seek%20and%20Find%20Collection%201"}]},{"igdb_id":146582,"name":"Seek and Find Collection 2","summary":"In Seek & Find Collection 2 there's more images to search the 7 differences before the time is up.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":["SelectSoft Publishing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1293753600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8hvj.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1688364230","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Seek%20and%20Find%20Collection%202"}]},{"igdb_id":147096,"name":"Sector 781","summary":"Battle your way through 3 realms of 'Sector 781', a pixel art platformer.

The action is shown from a top-down perspective which only shows a part of the playfield. The controls only use one button to initiate a shot: how long the button is pressed determines the strength and the direction pad controls the direction. However, there is also a novice mode available with the usual division between a shoot and pass button. Another important option is the dribbling (novice or expert) which sets how well the ball sticks to the controlled athlete. Before starting a match, there are also some limited tactical options available (choosing the formation and switching the position of athletes around).\n\nIn contrast to the computer versions there are no pre-set tournaments, but the player can start two tournaments with customizable requirements: cup or league. The cup allows to set the number of rounds (one to four) and some rules can be switched on or off for each round individually (number of legs, extra time, penalties). The league on the other hand has the options number of teams (between one and seven), how often the teams face each other (between once and four times) and if a win rewards two or three points. The pitch type (normal, dry, wet, icy, hard or random) can be set in both modes. There are twenty national and twenty club teams (all with slightly changed original names) to choose from.

A statement from Microsoft confirmed that an incorrect version of the game had been made available, in which online play was not possible.

The player controls pilots of robots throughout the entire campaign, battling against various types of enemies on an isometric field. All main characters possess powers that can give them a necessary edge in the battle. When enemy units are defeated, characters earn \"prāna\", their willpower. When prāna increases to a certain level, characters can perform more powerful attacks on the enemy.\n\nThis game is actually a spiritual successor to the Masou Kishin: The Lord of Elemental, previously developed by Banpresto and Winky Soft. Banpresto went to develop the Super Robot Wars/Taisen franchise, while Winky Soft decided to make a game reminiscent of the original Masou Kishin. As such, the game shares many similarities with each other, including the combat, the gameplay, its mechanics, the science-fantasy setting, and even the design of the protagonist. However, the main story, while similar, plays out differently. Also, all combat in the game is performed on the playing field itself, i.e. it does not cut to a separate combat screen. The biggest addition to the genre is the character progression system in a \"visual novel\" style. After missions, players can talk to various characters and, depending on the choices, increase their loyalty levels. Such changes can have an impact on the performance of their teammates in battle.\n\nThe game was also released for the Dreamcast console and got a sequel in Playstation 2.","genres":["Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Tactical"],"developers":["Winky Soft Co., Ltd."],"publishers":["Winky Soft Co., Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":953769600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaatf.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2104248614","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Seireiki%20Rayblade"}]},{"igdb_id":166960,"name":"Sengo Muramasa DX: Guren no Kettou - Limited Edition","summary":"This edition includes the following\nGame: Sengo Muramasa DX: Guren no Kettou\nArtbook\nSoundtrack CD","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Tactical","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Gesen 18"],"publishers":["SystemSoft Alpha"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1508976000,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation Vita"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9cdr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":167001,"name":"Semispheres: Orange Cover - Limited Edition","summary":"This edition includes the following\nSemispheres Collector’s Box\nSemispheres Game Disc\nSemispheres Game Manual\nSemispheres Original Soundtrack\nSemispheres Numbered Certificate","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"67492665","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Semispheres:%20Orange%20Cover%20-%20Limited%20Edition"}]},{"igdb_id":167011,"name":"Senran Kagura Burst Re:Newal - Nyuu Nyuu DX Pack Limited Edition","summary":"This edition includes the following\nGame: Senran Kagura Burst Re:Newal\nLuxury Booklet\nDrama CD\nStrap Set with Collection Box\nCharacter Card Set with DLC","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":167021,"name":"Sengoku Musou 4-II: Treasure Box","summary":"This edition includes the following\nGame: Sengoku Musou 4-II\nOriginal Clock\nSengoku Musou 4-II Characters Card for Clock (56pcs)\nOriginal Soundtrack","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":167028,"name":"Sengoku Hime 7: Senun Tsuranuku Guren no Ishi - Limited Edition","summary":"This edition includes the following:\n\n- Sengoku Hime 7: Sen'un Tsuranuku Guren no Ishi\n- Artbook\n- Drama CD","genres":["Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Gesen 18"],"publishers":["Unicorn-A","System Soft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1539216000,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation Vita"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa6rn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":167034,"name":"Semispheres: Blue Cover Limited Edition","summary":"This edition includes the following:\n\n- Semispheres Collector’s Box\n- Semispheres Game Disc\n- Semispheres Game Manual\n- Semispheres Original Soundtrack\n- Semispheres Numbered Certificate","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":167084,"name":"Sengoku Koihime: Otome Kenran Sengoku Emaki - Limited Edition","summary":"This edition includes the following\nGame: Sengoku Koihime: Otome Kenran Sengoku Emaki\nTapestry\nFive-star Gacha Ticket Set","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":167387,"name":"Sex Quest","summary":"Sex Quest is an action RPG adventure where you play a warrior maiden who is tasked with freeing the kingdom of a evil goblin warlock who has enslaved the king.

A subsistence where characters dwell. It is a choose your own adventure type of game but there are mysteries to solve and connections to unfold. Journey through here but remember you may not stay.\n\nLooking deeper at Seul.(Alone) it is a philosophical thriller, meaning it is a thriller based on thrilling philosophical ideas and contains horror elements. From nihilism, existentialism, surrealism, solipsism and absurdism. A narrative told with these ideas kept in mind. I wanted to play on these thoughts but also present some Lynchian kind of world where nothing makes much sense at first glance but as one adapts to it, when it manages to invade itself into you. You begin to see that mostly everything is staged within the game for a reason, a motivation sits behind every image and sentence.\n\nSeul.(Alone) is aimed to be a detective styled game where every choice has weight and you can feel that but I also wanted it to be about nothing. Like how dreams can feel at times. It seems so heavy and important to the dreamer while the dream is happening but when one wakes it seems to lose all its importance or even its sensibility. The weight of it has dissipated and you are left with this odd out of place feeling while you lay there replaying the memory of the dream you just had.\n\nBut at times those dreams can still affect you if you lay there and really begin to pull them apart and ask why, what was the reason for that? Where did those thoughts come from? What is my subconscious communicating, where are the links to my life? Now you are studying the dream… and there’s a whole ocean of stuff behind that now, connections, motivations and meanings. This is what I want to achieve in Seul.(Alone) and you mostly ever find yourself studying those areas of your life when you are truly Seul.(Alone).","genres":["Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1518912000,"platforms":["iOS"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1288072676","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Seul.%28Alone%29%20The%20Entr%C3%A9e%20-%20CYOA"}]},{"igdb_id":175559,"name":"Secret Agent Game: The 5 Keys","summary":"Secret Agent Game: The 5 Keys is a point and click adventure game unlike anything you have ever played before.

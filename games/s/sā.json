Compared to the previous title, the combat system has undergone major upgrades: battles now unfold as large-scale clashes involving multiple factions. Iconic military strategies once confined to books or real-life history — from siege warfare and rescue operations to breakouts, night raids, and psychological tactics — are now fully integrated into the gameplay.\n\nBoth in terms of scale and intensity, the action is far more ambitious than before. No longer is the battlefield just a place for chaotic button-mashing; intelligence and strategy are just as important as raw strength. Every decision the player makes influences the course of the game, shaping not only how battles unfold, but also how the story is written.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Acer TWP"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1030838400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa1s1.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1580729895","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/S%C4%81ngu%C3%B3%20Zh%C3%A0o%20Y%C3%BAn%20Zhu%C3%A0n%20Zh%C4%AB%20Z%C3%B2ngh%C3%A9ng%20Ti%C4%81nxi%C3%A0"}]},{"igdb_id":356018,"name":"Sānguó Yǎnyì: Huǒshāo Chìbì","summary":null,"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Gamtec"],"publishers":["Li Cheng"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":851990400,"platforms":["Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa5ai.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"421631924","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sanguo%20Yanyi:%20Huoshao%20Chibi"}]},{"igdb_id":367133,"name":"Sānguó Zhī Nù","summary":"Orthodox game of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, you will become one leader of a dynasty, to lead legendary generals riding across re-created epic battlefields as thousands of people will capture cities and seize territories.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1711411200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaggu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2850350","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2850350"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"84895771","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/S%C4%81ngu%C3%B3%20Zh%C4%AB%20N%C3%B9"}]},{"igdb_id":367273,"name":"Sānguózhì Juéxǐng","summary":null,"genres":["Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["SG-game"],"publishers":["SG-game"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1718582400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coakr7.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3007340","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3007340"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"766187034","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/S%C4%81ngu%C3%B3zh%C3%AC%20Ju%C3%A9x%C7%90ng"}]},{"igdb_id":368105,"name":"Sānguó Qún Jiàng Zhuàn","summary":"Experience the Epic Three Kingdoms Era in Sanguo Qun Jiang Zhuan!\n\nEmbark on an unforgettable journey through ancient China in San Guo Qun Jiang Zhuan, a thrilling strategy RPG where you'll command legendary heroes and build your own empire.

The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's height and three bombs.\n\nThe bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like \"S\" power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn \"B\" icons that increases the player's bomb stock when destroyed.\nEvery time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player's total score.\n\nPlayers are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Completing the last stage restarts the game with the second loop increasing in difficulty.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Toaplan"],"publishers":["Firebird","Ving Co., Ltd.","Kaneko","Romstar","Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":542678400,"platforms":["Arcade","Sharp X68000","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","DOS","FM Towns","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6ovw.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"34260","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Flying Shark"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6813","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-6813/"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"38175","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-38175/"}]},{"igdb_id":12267,"name":"Skate or Die","summary":null,"genres":["Racing","Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["Electronic Arts"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Apple IIGS","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","DOS","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5wcd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12637,"name":"Skyshine's Bedlam","summary":"BEDLAM is a strategic turn-based strategy game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission.

Since ancient times, fabulous creatures goblin, kikimors, swamp spirits and many others have always helped ordinary wanderers and heroes. They gave them gifts in every possible way and supported them in their development. And there was an idyll between people and creatures, everyone lived in peace and harmony. But over time, more and more people began to be attracted and interested in the wealth of fairy-tale heroes. Because of human greed and cruelty, the first disagreements arose. People began to enslave creatures with impunity. Greed and lust for profit overshadowed their minds. And then Perun decided to protect the creatures from people and endowed them with incredible strength and abilities to protect humans from the misfortune. He split the old world and created several new ones, scattered riches over unknown distances, which the creatures reliably guarded. \n \nThe strategic component of the game is determined by two main conditions: \n1. There are two types of interaction between players in the game. Either the player becomes a prince and develops by capturing and surrounding locations belonging to other players, or he becomes a fiefdom and at these locations is mining items and materials. In fact, this is a symbiosis, some players are engaged in mining, others protect them by receiving profit from them, while they jointly expand their possessions by spreading their influence to other principalities and cities. The mechanics of capturing and surrounding locations is a separate game, reminiscent of a game of \"dots\" on a large spherical world with a size of 25,000 hexagons. \n \n \n2. Players, through close social interaction, identify leaders who are appointed to govern cities and states as a whole. Such players, while occupying positions, have mechanisms at their disposal to manage the economy of the game. They also develop a strategy for the development of the state as a whole, dictating foreign and domestic policies and the conditions for the existence of the players themselves in it. Such appointments occur weekly, so the dynamics of development in the game depends entirely on the correctness of the actions of the gaming community, as well as on the insight and wisdom of the rulers. \n \nIn the game, the strategy is the main point, however, in addition to this, all the basic familiar mechanics are implemented, grind for grinders, battle for battles, sandbox for sandstone, casual for casual, craft for crafters, etc., but made with a new look at making games. Everything here is comfortably balanced and everyone will find for themselves what they need.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Skilled Craftmans"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1571097600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2kuo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":141299,"name":"Sketchbots","summary":"Hone your programming skills through a series of increasingly complex challenges in which you use a node based language to guide your robot through the required goals.","genres":["Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Feel Good OPG"],"publishers":["Feel Good OPG"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1606089600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2l6q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":142377,"name":"Skulldash","summary":"Skulldash is a megawad and time-trial styled gameplay mod for GZDoom (3.2.0 and higher) created by Joshua O'Sullivan (Dragonfly).

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins…","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1621987200,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5asm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1999085067","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Skittles"}]},{"igdb_id":149050,"name":"SkyLife: VoxelSurvival","summary":"An open world FPS game in voxel world.

While some world types are based on the classic tree on dirt others are designed with unique recipes and advancements.\n\nWhat makes this version different from every other SkyFactory before it? We've completely redesigned the resource gathering. Sieving for resources are a thing of the past. For a more immersive experience, Sky Orchards has been introduced. Resource Trees provides a built-in progression system and lets the player choose the resources they want to produce rather than a randomized system. We've removed the achievement book and replaced it with the advancement system. Instead of requiring players to manually check out what they've accomplished, the game will keep track for you. This system isn't designed to create a required questing system, but rather an optional set of goals for players looking for ideas on what to do next.\n\nSkyFactory 4 introduces the prestige system! This is a completely optional game mode allowing you to unlock mods, items, and mechanics through an open progression system. Prestige points and unlocks are global and can be brought with you to other worlds! Prestige points can be gained by finishing advancements or by using the Parabox, a time-traveling box that generates points.

This process combines Oblivion’s impressive award-winning open-world that is renowned for its incredible gameplay, memorable quests, and expansive world space with the advancements in gaming that have been made in the last two decades. Set in the Elder Scroll’s Third Era, during the cataclysmic Oblivion Crisis, you must help to restore the Imperial throne and repel the demonic Daedric invasion.\n\nSkyblivion will feature the remastered entirety of Oblivion’s mainland, Cyrodiil, from the wintery slopes of the Valus and Jerall Mountains to the swamps of Blackwood and warm-beachy shores of the Gold Coast. Skyblivion will bring the return of many classic Oblivion mechanics like spell crafting, a complete class and attributes system, underwater combat, and NPC disposition.\n\nIn addition to recreating Oblivion’s systems and porting them into the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim’s engine the project has taken great care in providing new improvements and additions. Skyblivion offers fans remastered graphics, weather, and lighting, an expanded soundtrack, new gameplay mechanics, and even a limited selection of bespoke minor quests with original voice acting to further flesh out barren areas of Oblivion—all for free!\n\nOnce Skyblivion is released in 2025, fans will have access to the entirety of Oblivion’s pre-DLC world space, systems, and quests available for play. But that’s not the end of the project! Following a period of bug-fixing and community-supported updates the project development team will move on to working on Oblivion’s nine additional content releases plus the Shivering Isles expansion.\n\nWith Skyblivion you experience the best of both worlds: The complex and detailed RPG experience of Oblivion paired with Skyrim’s newer systems, graphics, and quality of life improvements.

It is now listed under Quests and Adventures, since there is no New Lands category.\n\nThey said it couldn't be done... Daggerfall is too big to fit in the TESV engine... And they were, on the one hand, right! You cannot capture the grand scale or the nearly endless possibilities that exist in a world larger than England! Yet, for all of its vastness and promise, Daggerfall remains a world unfamiliar to many Elder Scrolls fans. The mechanics and graphics feel dated to say the least, and its sometimes unreasonable time limits for quests as well as quest-breaking bugs left many players, even back in the '90's, so frustrated that perhaps a majority of players never finished the Main Quest, preferring to simply explore the world on their own terms, joining guilds or Knightly Orders, or becoming a vampire or a wereboar. And that is a shame, because the Main Quest is actually quite a good story. The purpose of this mod is not to replace TESII: Daggerfall, but to bring some of its magic and lore to Elder Scrolls fans of the Skyrim generation that would never otherwise experience it, as well as perhaps delight those fans of the original game that would love to see the Main Quest in an updated engine, complete with voice acting, re-mastered music and better graphics.\n\nPlease note that the Main Quest of Daggerfall is NOT about choice. You are role-playing as the Emperor's friend on an important mission, so, while the order in which you tackle these quests is your choice, it is assumed that you want to finish the Main Quest and so you will not be able to refuse the quest-givers' requests. At this point, there really isn't much of anything other than the Main Quest for you to do in Daggerfall, anyway!\n\nI have worked on this mod in my spare time for a little over two years, and have had a lot of fun learning about various aspects that go into making a large mod the size of a dlc. I'm not much of a 3D artist, so I've had to rely on a lot of resources to put this mod together, and you will see that the credits list is quite long. I have tried to include, where possible, those models from artists who have made resources to see something from Daggerfall come to later Elder Scrolls games, such as JMan0WarS, who remade Privateer's Hold for Morrowind as well as Direnni Tower for Oblivion, Lord Berandas and BobJohnson99. As per Bethesda's instructions, all assets included in this mod for Skyrim have been remade, and not simply ported from the original Daggerfall game.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1569974400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9do9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":317015,"name":"Skylanders: SuperChargers","summary":"Exclusive to the Wii U version of the game is a special figure of Donkey Kong and Bowser.","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Vicarious Visions"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1442707200,"platforms":["Wii U"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8tsk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":317016,"name":"Skylanders: Imaginators","summary":"Exclusive to the Wii U and Nintendo Switch versions of the game is a special figure of Donkey Kong and Bowser.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Toys for Bob"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1476316800,"platforms":["Wii U","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8tsm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":317137,"name":"Sky Streaker","summary":"Dodge clothes, grab coins, and outrun Gumball and Darwin as you climb sky high!","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Cartoon Network"],"publishers":["Cartoon Network"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1449446400,"platforms":["Web browser","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8u0u.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1591145735","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sky%20Streaker"}]},{"igdb_id":317458,"name":"SkyGunner","summary":"Experience SkyGunner originally released on the PlayStation2 console, enhanced with up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Arcade"],"developers":["PixelArts"],"publishers":["Sony Interactive Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1726531200,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8uf8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10011230","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011230"}]},{"igdb_id":317531,"name":"Skyx","summary":"Skyx takes over the same operation while bringing it a new dimension.

Sky Shark (released in Japan as \"Hi Sho Zame\", and in Europe as \"Flying Shark\")is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game in which players take control of the titular biplane through five increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like tanks, battleships, airplanes and artillery as the main objective. The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's height and three bombs.\n\nThe bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like \"S\" power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn \"B\" icons that increases the player's bomb stock when destroyed.\nEvery time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player's total score.\n\nPlayers are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.

There's also the fighting aspect of the game where Quinn has to fight enemies to progress by using an assortment of high, medium, or low punches or kicks. Quinn doesn't enter Fight Mode automatically, so if you want him to fight, you need to put him into Fight Mode. Unlike Prince of Persia, however, there are four difficulties to choose from which make the game easier or harder overall.\n\nThe game ushers you along by issuing way points directly under your Compass, showing you exactly where you need to be heading to progress the story. This could be anywhere from a local tavern to a magical tower on an entirely different tier of the city. Due to this linearity, it's almost impossible to become lost in the game or otherwise stuck. This game also has no inventory system, but there are chests scattered around the world which contain useful items such as Medical Herbs or quest-related items such as the Crazy Guy's Rat which progress the story or can be traded for other items such as new weaponry.\n\nAs stated, there are four difficulties. In addition to Easy, Normal, and Hard, a fourth difficulty–\"Very Easy\"–exists which allows you to cheat your way through the game by giving you infinite hit points or even making you complete immune to being hit. There doesn't seem to be any drawbacks to this mode aside from the possibility of getting stuck in certain traps which would otherwise kill you immediately.\n\nLastly, every now and then you'll be treated to an in-game animated cut scene which furthers the story of Quinn. These cut scenes are fully voiced (using tracks from the CD-ROM) and animated, the art style differing slightly from either the cover art or the in game sprites.

The combo system seems to range up to the max of 10 in battle. Story mode, Vs mode, and Arcade mode are the three playable modes within this game. In Story mode, you will experience various cutscenes and additional minigames. Arcade mode seems to be the same except for the fact that you will be continuously battling. Of course within Vs mode, you can battle against a friend or a com. Overall within this game, 17 characters are playable (3 of which being different versions of Yoh). It is known that Hao can also be playable, but a Gameshark code is needed. Fortunately, as well within battle, character voices will be experienced rather commonly, in which anime cutscenes will be experienced at times - such as in the intro.

It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. The main characters' quest is to investigate mysterious \"windows\" from which vicious monsters pop out.\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes, as well as many other actions throughout the game. A new \"Stock\" system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts - Covenant and enables double attacks.\n\nThe \"Stock\" system works by filling up a character's stock gauge when he/she performs or receives an attack. A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored. Stock can then be utilized in many ways. For example, doing a Double attack (a character performs two action on the same turn) or starting a Combo consumes one Stock. A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock. The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts: Covenant, with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available.\n\nMagic returns in the form of Stellar Charts, where characters equip Stellars onto the chart. The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs. Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar, the strongest non-elemental magic in the game.\n\nFusion is also back in the game, albeit quite differently. Unlike Yuri, Shania does not possess the power of the Harmonixer where she is able to fuse into different demons. She makes spirit pacts with the different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform. Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes; statues of different animals, she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up.\n\nSnapping photos is more emphasized in this game. Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies, he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes. Johnny can also draw upon the power of Malice to transform; though this ability comes rather late in the game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["Nautilus"],"publishers":["Aruze","Ghostlight Ltd.","XSEED Games"],"aggregated_rating":75.0,"release_date":1122508800,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa8m9.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"11345","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shadow Hearts: From the New World"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"12349","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-12349/"}]},{"igdb_id":4265,"name":"Shanghai: Triple-Threat","summary":"Another version of the ancient game of Mah-Jong.

Several hostages are being held in each stage; Joe must rescue all of them before he is allowed to finish the stage. The last stage in each mission has no hostages, but instead features a powerful boss character whom Joe must defeat. After completing each of the first four missions the player is taken to a bonus stage, where he can earn an extra life if he is able to kill all of the ninjas leaping towards him. Completing the fifth mission ends the game. Also, once the fifth mission begins, continues are no longer allowed; the player has to finish the game with however many lives he has left at that point. If the player earns a place on the high score board, the number of credits it took him to get that score is displayed along with his score.\n\nJoe's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shuriken, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. One hostage per stage gives him a power-up. When powered-up, his throwing stars are replaced by a gun that fires large, explosive bullets, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Joe can also perform \"ninja magic,\" which may be used only once per stage and kills (or damages, in the case of bosses) all enemies on the screen. The game also allows the enemies to hide behind boxes or use shields to block Musashi's shurikens.[4]\n\nJoe can be killed with one hit, provided he is hit by a projectile or melee attack, but if he does not find himself in those situations, the player can touch regular enemies and just be pushed back without being damaged. Since most enemies appear in the same place on each level, it is possible to master the game by memorizing their locations and devising patterns to defeat them.\n\nAt the end of each stage, the player receives score bonuses based on performance. Completing the stage without using ninja magic or without using any throwing stars or bullets earns the player a point bonus. The player has three minutes to complete each stage; remaining time at the end of the stage is also converted to bonus points and added to the player's score.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Team Shinobi"],"publishers":["Asmik Corporation","Virgin Mastertronic","Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","The Sales Curve"],"aggregated_rating":60.0,"release_date":564019200,"platforms":["Arcade","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","DOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2wg2.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3482","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-3482/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3196","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shinobi"}]},{"igdb_id":7185,"name":"Sharin no Kuni: The Girl Among the Sunflowers","summary":"Early summer.\n\nA society which imposes special \"Duties\" upon everyone who breaks the law.\n\nThe individuals who oversee these criminals' rehabilitation are the \"Special Elite\"ーa rank the protagonist, Kenichi Morita, hopes to attain.

The player can use the right control stick to aim with a laser sight. Gameplay in Shadow Complex was inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The gameplay takes many cues from Metroid: the player can move freely throughout the expansive game world, defeating enemies with a variety of weapons, and as they overcome challenges, they gain new abilities and weapons which allow them to reach new areas.\nThe game rewards the player with experience points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic attributes of the character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, they will lose all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any benefits they have already received from that experience.\nIn addition to the main campaign, a number of challenge levels, called \"Proving Grounds\", are available, generally requiring the player to make it to the exit of a room using a limited set of items and health. Players are ranked based on time of completion and any scoring objectives when they complete the level. Scores and other statistics from the main campaign and the training group are tracked via online leaderboards.\nA remastered version and port was announced during the 215 Game Awards, to be released for PS4, Xbox One, PC.","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["ChAIR Entertainment Group","Epic Games"],"publishers":["Microsoft Game Studios","Epic Games"],"aggregated_rating":85.0,"release_date":1250640000,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2421.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11542,"name":"Shenmue III","summary":"Shenmue III is an action-adventure video game and the sequel to the 2001 game Shenmue II.

Like most titles Infocom produced, the use of ZIL made it possible to release the game simultaneously for many popular computer platforms, including the Apple II, IBM PC, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. Sherlock is based on the legendary fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is Infocom's thirty-first game and is the first of two Infocom games developed by Challenge, Inc. using Infocom's development tools.\n\nThe year is 1887, and all of England is gearing up for the celebration of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, marking her 50th year as monarch. London, naturally, is especially frenzied. Reading the paper one morning, Sherlock Holmes seizes upon one seemingly unimportant notice: the Tower of London has been closed for \"reasons of security.\" The great detective is unsurprised when, moments later, he is asked to investigate the theft of the Crown Jewels. The clues left behind, however, positively reek of a carefully laid trap; Sherlock decides that he must step aside and allow Dr. Watson to pursue the thief instead. But if the Jewels are not replaced within 48 hours, the British government will be forced to admit that their most prized possessions were stolen and suffer worldwide humiliation.\n\nThe player fills the role of Watson, travelling around London in Hansom cabs while attempting to recover the Crown Jewels while encountering many characters from Doyle's stories such as Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft Holmes, and Wiggins of the Baker Street Irregulars.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Challenge, Inc."],"publishers":["Infocom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":599529600,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","Mac","DOS","Amiga","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5w31.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"19395","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-19395/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"17752","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sherlock%3A%20The%20Riddle%20of%20the%20Crown%20Jewels"}]},{"igdb_id":12764,"name":"Shadow Sorcerer","summary":"Shadow Sorcerer is a tie-in with the Dragonlance series of novels.

The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Messians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. People flock into the encapsulated city, submitting themselves to the strict hierarchy imposed by the Messian Center, where only the privileged living in the Center district are safe from demonic assaults.\n\nA few years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto rescues a man named Hawk, who was fighting for his life against a demon. He trains him to fight in the arena of the Valhalla district, hoping that he would win the tournament, which will grant them both citizenship in the Center district. When Hawk succeeds, he is brought before a Messian bishop, and learns the shocking truth about his own origins and the role he is supposed to play in the grand scheme of events.

Dozens of versions and tributes to the game, both official and unofficial, have been created for virtually every computer, console, handheld, tablet, phone, and operating system in the decades since its original release. It is undoubtedly a classic from the golden era of arcade games.\n\nShoot The Rocks is a little different in that it runs cross-platform, on both desktop and laptop computers, as well as on iOS and Android phones and tablets. This is thanks to the fact that it runs in browser using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, rather than Adobe's proprietary Flash platform. This means that no special plugins are required and, if you have a recent version of a mainstream browser, you should be good to go.\n\nIn Shoot The Rocks the aim of the game is to defend your ship from wave after wave of incoming asteroids and flying saucers. This sounds simple but quickly becomes very challenging, and you'll need to use every trick of fancy flying available to you - plus hyperspace, shield, and flip functions - to stay in the game.\n\nShoot The Rocks combines elements of both the original Asteroids, along with its follow-up, Asteroids Plus, with its own unique spin to create an engaging and addictive game. Two modes of play are offered. Classic mode aims to play as much like the original asteroids as possible, whilst the modern mode offers a slightly different take that should appeal to both fans of the original and newer players.","genres":["Shooter","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["arcade.ly"],"publishers":["arcade.ly"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1483228800,"platforms":["Web browser","Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pk4gnb0wmycg3umezsqb.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"23771","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shoot%20the%20Rocks"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"26297","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-26297/"}]},{"igdb_id":28813,"name":"Shadow Block","summary":"Shadow Block is a atmospheric, simple, 2d platformer that provides a fair challenge.

In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood to spurt out, which became popularized a few months later by Midway's Mortal Kombat. The main unique feature of Shogun Warriors is its \"grabbing system\". When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to make it more difficult for his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Kaneko"],"publishers":["Sammy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":696902400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8hg8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"26538","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shogun%20Warriors"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"29431","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-29431/"}]},{"igdb_id":40651,"name":"Shootin' Gallery","summary":"Similar to the game Carnival, you must shoot targets and guard your ammunition supply.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Imagic"],"publishers":["Imagic"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":412905600,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hktvndfz3zwreb9rtkhs.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"275","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shootin'%20Gallery"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"296","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-296/"}]},{"igdb_id":40694,"name":"Shuttle Orbiter","summary":"Shuttle Orbiter is a race against time to complete the Space Station.

Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father.\n\nJulian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion.

Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!!

Instead of the camera being behind the batter or pitcher, the player can see both from an angle, with the two situated diagonally from each other. Likewise, the baseball diamond is shown at an angle making it appear more like a square, with the rest of the field stretching outwards. Despite this new perspective, the game controls similarly to previous Bases Loaded games.\n\nA curious addition is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":617500800,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hnlkwfenycbjbqg2rpqe.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"41423","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-41423/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"112938","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shin%20Moero!!%20Pro%20Yakyuu"}]},{"igdb_id":48848,"name":"Shin 4-nin Uchi Mahjong: Yakuman Tengoku","summary":"The sole installment of the Yakuman series on the Famicom.\n\nShin 4-nin Uchi Mahjong: Yakuman Tengoku is a Miscellaneous game, published by Nintendo, which was released in Japan in 1991.","genres":["Sport","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Nintendo"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":678067200,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cjg1u2dkvbgmkgywfpfu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"43450","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-43450/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"313361","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shin%204-nin%20Uchi%20Mahjong:%20Yakuman%20Tengoku"}]},{"igdb_id":48849,"name":"Shuffle Fight","summary":"Shuffle Fight is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Pandora Box and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1992.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Banpresto"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":721267200,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co745l.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1260667459","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shuffle%20Fight"}]},{"igdb_id":49111,"name":"Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling: Toukon Sanjushi","summary":"The handheld fighting spirit of New Japan Pro Wrestling right in your hands!","genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Varie"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":680659200,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9i8u.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":49222,"name":"Shrek: Reekin' Havoc","summary":"In an effort to seek revenge on Shrek, Princess Fiona and all of the fairy tale characters, The Ghost of Lord Farquaad has cast an evil spell!

Django has to climb the Ancient Tree. At the top is Wings of Death, Hresvelgr, the second Immortal, who has captured Trinity and uses him as a bait to lure Django, as well as sucking power away from the tree. While keeping Trinity out of harm's way, Django defeats Hresvelgr, taking the coffin back to the Piledriver and successfully purifies him. However, as Django tries to return to San Miguel, The Count reappears, and challenges Django. Trinity freaks out and runs. Clouds cover the sky, and Dark Matter starts to rain down on Django. Trinity realizes that The Legend of The Warriors of Light is a true story: about Django. He believes that Django dies and the world ends because he \"betrayed\" Django. Django journeys to Pirate Island, where he learns more about Carmilla, and about what happened. Django defeats Machine King Nidhoggr, the Immortal charged with preventing Django from making it into space, and Piledrives him. Having a usable ship, Django heads back to the place where they fought. The Solar Boy enters a cannon and is fired into space, landing at the Dark Castle.\n\nDjango finds Carmilla before the last level and after talking, he decides to do all he can to save the world, even if that means losing his brother.\n\nMaking it to the core, Django fights against Vanargand (and Sabata).

As they reach the end of the road, Django and Otenko or Sabata combine their powers and finish Vanargand.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1125187200,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fgz.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1109003893","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shin%20Bokura%20no%20Taiyou:%20Gyakushuu%20no%20Sabata"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"11662","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-11662/"}]},{"igdb_id":49774,"name":"Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children - Messiah Riser","summary":"Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children - Messiah Riser is a Strategy game, developed by Rocket Company and published by Atlus, which was released in Japan in 2004.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Multimedia Intelligence Transfer"],"publishers":["Atlus"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1099526400,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7prm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":49775,"name":"Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children 2 - Koori no Sho","summary":"A Japan only Game Boy Advance game in the Shin Megami Tensei Devil Children series.

After a time, if the player has yet to be reacquired by the enemy, it will return to its original pathfinding.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["FromSoftware"],"publishers":["FromSoftware"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1223424000,"platforms":["Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5vd0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79726,"name":"Shin Megami Tensei if...","summary":"Shin Megami Tensei If... is a RPG that was developed as a change from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles, focusing on a small-scale environment and threat rather than a large-scale environment as in previous titles.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Atlus"],"publishers":["Index Corporation","Atlus"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":783302400,"platforms":["Wii","iOS","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26hy.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79858,"name":"Sharin no Kuni, Yuukyuu no Shounenshoujo","summary":"A fandisc sequel to Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":["Akabeisoft2"],"publishers":["MAGES."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1288224000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation Portable","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa3fc.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"33263","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sharin no Kuni, Yuukyuu no Shounenshoujo"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"37085","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-37085/"}]},{"igdb_id":79903,"name":"Shade","summary":"A one-room interactive fiction game set in your apartment.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Andrew Plotkin","Zarfhome Software"],"publishers":["Zarfhome Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":978220800,"platforms":["Web browser","Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fpe.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"18452","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18452/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"16911","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shade"}]},{"igdb_id":79985,"name":"Shooting Gallery","summary":"This is a light gun game where players shoot a single type of target in each round, including birds, balloons, blimps, balls, and spaceships.

So along with the survival elements you will also have the ability to create a new home for yourself on your island!\n\nThe challenge is not just one of escape but trying to make a new life for yourself, living off the islands resources and building your own home.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Zatara Software Ltd"],"publishers":["Zatara Software Ltd"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1538524800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x6n9xdij9onfiftfpvup.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":105434,"name":"Shape Puzzle - Toddler Educational Learning Games","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"476507543","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shape-puzzle-toddler-educational-learning-games/id476507543?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1020268518","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shape%20Puzzle%20-%20Toddler%20Educational%20Learning%20Games"}]},{"igdb_id":105503,"name":"Shaperoid","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":105518,"name":"Shooting King","summary":"FPS gaming experience with easy and casual controls.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4zfa.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":105522,"name":"Shi Sen","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":105859,"name":"Shadow Fighter Legend","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":15,"store":"xbox","uid":"com.ninjawarrior.shadowfighterwar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ninjawarrior.shadowfighterwar"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"91369465","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shadow%20Fighter%20Legend"}]},{"igdb_id":105895,"name":"Shoot Ball Fruit Splash","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"1404715677","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shoot-ball-fruit-splash/id1404715677?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"284256458","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shoot%20Ball%20Fruit%20Splash"}]},{"igdb_id":106371,"name":"Shape Sorter - Early Learning","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"637485337","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shape-sorter-early-learning/id637485337?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1424115562","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shape%20Sorter%20-%20Early%20Learning"}]},{"igdb_id":106443,"name":"Shadow Fear Path to Insanity","summary":"In the middle of the night you receive a call from your niece saying that her mom ( your sister ) \nas been gone to Lencour Mountain the day before and she never returned.

The story takes you to the peaceful town of Jaterus, about to become much less peaceful thanks to one Greymere. This evil archmage has taken up residence in a three-level dungeon, conveniently located just outside the city walls. More alarmingly, he has constructed the Shadowforge - a potent magical artifact that has enhanced both his power and ambition for conquest; Jaterus is first on his list. Your job is to quash his aspirations by finding and destroying the device.\n\nThe town of Jaterus is your base of operations, its main attractions being the weapon and armor shops, the inn (where you can recuperate after a sojourn to the dungeon), the temple (where health potions are sold), and the tavern (which, besides refreshments, offers conversation - some of it helpful). The various random NPCs do not communicate, though.\n\nThe dungeon is populated by Greymere's minions; some are randomly placed, others are not, and all must be bested in turn-based combat - the deeper you go, the tougher the bad guys. Fighting involves both melee and ranged attacks, and defeated monsters will bequeath both gold and experience. Leveling up will increase your maximum hit points, but no other stats are tracked. Some secrets await to be revealed along the way, too.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["John Carmack"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["Apple II"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"519039","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Shadowforge/"}]},{"igdb_id":139109,"name":"Shirahana no Ori - Hiiro no Kakera 4","summary":"A visual novel developped by Otomate and the prequel of the first Hiiro no Kakera.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":["Otomate"],"publishers":["Idea Factory"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1348099200,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ig2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":139158,"name":"Shaype","summary":"Shaype is a singleplayer fantasy action role-playing game with an emphasis on player agency, character progression, engaging combat, interactive dialogue, and player-driven narratives.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Sinking Ship Studios"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co91uu.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":139220,"name":"Shujinkou","summary":"A retired samurai (主) is entrusted with saving his home from intelligent, language-devouring \"Akuma\" alongside an eccentric fox (人) freed from a cursed abode and an astute princess (公) with her own ambitions.\n\nShujinkou is a dungeon-crawling JRPG that offers a unique opportunity to learn Japanese as you play.

The ten female commanders reside in the castle and can be approached in any order. Each of them transfers the player to a different location (alternating between urban, dungeon-like, and rural areas) where a tactical battle takes place. Every commander is responsible for a unit type in the army. These types include Lancers, Fighters, Swordsmen, Cannoneers, Horsemen, Archers, Mages, Ninjas, Dragon Riders, and Birds. Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority. The battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares.

You can attempt this quest solo or you can allow three other players to attempt the quest as well, each taking it in turns at various points. Three skill levels can also be picked.\n\nShades is a flick-screen arcade adventure where each screen is viewed from an elevated angle as you explore the island. You are armed with a sword (a crossbow can be found later) and as you move about the island you can encounter many monsters who can either be avoided, fought or pleaded with but if pleading fails then you can fight or run away. On each screen are many traps and you can search by pressing T but be careful because if there are many traps then not all will be revealed at first. Secret doors can also be searched for by pressing E and these are an important part to complete your quest. Fighting or hurting your self on traps decreases a Physical State bar but if you can avoid battles this can increase slowly if in the green section. Once the bar is empty then it is game over for that player.\n\nScattered around the island are chests containing various objects to help you in your quest. You can carry up to eight items and any items carried can be dropped or used in various locations to aid you on your quest. Objects cannot be dropped on stairs or The Moors as the winds would blow them away. Taking objects or fighting monsters increase your experience and is used as a high score at the end of the game. As you explore the island the Shades curse can hit you and transport you to an earlier location you visited.

The unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization filled the air with smog, robbing humanity of the blue skies they'd once known. There is one place in particular where the sky is darker than anywhere else: the ruins of the Engine city New York, perpetually shrouded in grey clouds and polluted rain. Five years ago, a mysterious disaster known as the \"Great Disappearance\" reduced this entire metropolis to a deserted, crumbling wasteland. Sealed off from the world by the United States government, it stands in utter silence. Not a single soul now walks its streets. But today, a woman named Elysia quietly sets foot inside it - guided by a singular purpose. Her destination: old Manhattan, said to be the epicenter of the catastrophe. Unbeknownst to her... There is a place said to be the city's \"Underground.\" This is an enormous subterranean realm, permeated with a dim purple light. No one on the surface world knows of its existence. In this place, the Skyscrapers that crumbled five years ago still stand tall; but their forms are warped and twisted. \"Underground New York\" is a place of black and violet shadows. A prison with no exit. And beneath its unnatural \"sky,\" the men and women who vanished five years ago still exist... Cowering in fear of the seven monsters known as the \"Messengers.\" Suffering terror, agony, and death at the hands of the \"Messengers.\" They linger on in this twisted underground city, as if waiting for something. A girl named Lily sets foot in this place, her mind devoid of memories. There is only one thing she's certain of. She doesn't have a reason. She doesn't know who or what awaits her.

How Axlon was involved is unknown, but they may have simply sub-contracted the game out to Heuristica instead of doing it themselves. So why wasn't Shooting Arcade released? No one knows the true reason, but one possibility is the flawed targeting system of the Light Gun. Another possibility is the late date of the game (1989).

Stage layouts are slightly different, and the decision to use sprites similar in size to the arcade version means that fewer enemies can appear on screen at any one time. Sprite flicker is a common sight, and entire sections of stages are removed to save space. Unlike the arcade version, players cannot backtrack during either side-scrolling or boss sections, limiting player to a very small section of the screen during the boss fights.\n\nThe most striking omission in the Master System version of Shadow Dancer is the dog as an active character, but it is still available as a game mechanic. When a valid target is onscreen, the player must crouch. While crouched, the ninja magic icon will slowly transform into a a dog head. When the icon is completely full, it will move to the target enemy's location. Pressing attack will cause the dog to appear out of nowhere and attack the enemy. If no valid target exists, the icon will not move and pressing attack while crouched will perform a normal attack. The dog can be called only three times each stage.\n\nThe Master System version retains the first-person shuriken-throwing bonus rounds, but the one between the second and third stage is the same bonus round used by the Mega Drive version, which makes player to jump from a tall building and attack ninjas in a downward shoot-'em-up fashion.\n\nLike the Master System version of Shinobi, ninja magic cannot be used during boss fights. In addition to the previously mentioned problem of being confined to a small section of the screen, this makes the boss fights even more difficult than the arcade version.\n\nA small oddity, in the Master System version, Shinobi always bows to the boss before the battle.","genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"publishers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":675734400,"platforms":["Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa4km.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":308549,"name":"ShedHorror","summary":"You've cornered yourself in a tiny shed in an attempt to hide from the creature that has been hunting you down.

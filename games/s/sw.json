The overall structure corresponds to that of a traditional Japanese RPG: the player navigates the heroes through top-down environments, buying supplies in town, advancing the narrative in a linear way, and fighting enemies to gain experience and level up automatically. Like in the first game, the battles are action sequences that take place in small side-scrolling areas, similarly to fighting games. However, unlike in the predecessor, the enemies are visibly walking on the screen.\n\nThe fighting game element is more developed in the second game; two additional modes (beside the main story mode) are accessible from the main menu: \"monster attack\" and \"vs. mode\". Monster attack mode allows the player to select one of the game's heroes and fight increasingly stronger monsters; \"vs. mode\" features two-player competition.","genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Technical Group Laboratory, Inc."],"publishers":["Technical Group Laboratory, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":769910400,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9tj1.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2107265302","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sword%20Dancer:%20Kyoujin%20no%20Megami"}]},{"igdb_id":344508,"name":"Swamp Fellas","summary":"Swamp Fellas is a cozy multiplayer game up to 8 players where frogs fish, vibe, and cause mild chaos.

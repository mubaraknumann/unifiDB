As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game's sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.\n\nThe gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received. When Life is lost, the main character can be revived, but if all Cosmos is lost, then the game is over.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Hect Co.

The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan.\n\nSamurai Spirits - Kenkaku Shinan Pack is a compilation only released in Japan that includes the first two Samurai Spirits games.\n\nSAMURAI SPIRITS:\nSamurai Shodown, known as Samurai Spirits in Japan, is a 1993 competitive fighting game produced by SNK for their Neo Geo arcade and home platform. In contrast to other fighting games at the time which were set in modern times and focused primarily on hand-to-hand combat, Samurai Shodown is set in feudal-era Japan (similar to Kaneko's Shogun Warriors) and was one of the first fighting games to focus primarily on weapon-based combat after the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II.\n\nWhen SNK released the game for the home console version of the Neo Geo system, the AES, the fans bought it up in droves, and it still stands as the most successful run of home Neo cartridges ever produced. The game was ported to multiple other platforms, including the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear, Sega CD, Sega Saturn, 3DO, FM Towns, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.\n\nSTORY:\nIn early Japan, a man named Shiro Tokisada Amakusa preaches a heretic religion. Little does anyone know that Amakusa is really a servant of the evil Ambrosia, who took over Amakusa's body. Ambrosia wishes to shroud the world in darkness. Now, choose between 12 warriors (and 3 bonus characters) to fight for the honor of destroying Amakusa, and fulfilling a mission.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nPlayable characters include:\n\n- Haohmaru - the main hero; a ronin who travels to sharpen his swordsmanship and his sense of bushido.\n\n- Nakoruru - an Ainu miko who fights to protect Mother Nature.\n\n- Ukyo Tachibana - an ailing narcisist swordsman who searches for the perfect flower for his loved one, Kei.\n\n- Wan-fu - a power general from the Qing dynasty seeking to recruit powerful warriors for the unification of China.\n\n- Tam Tam - renowned Maya hero from Mexico (referred to as \"Green Hell\" in the game); he fights to retrieve the sacred artifact, the Palenke Stone.\n\n- Charlotte Christine Colde - a noblewoman fencer from Versailles who fights to save her country from Amakusa.\n\n- Galford D. Weller - American sailor turned ninja who fights in the name of justice.\n\n- Kyoshiro Senryo - famed kabuki performer who wishes to strengthen his dances through swordplay.\n\n- Earthquake - American ninja and Flunky-turned bandit, he wants to steal all the world's treasure.\n\n- Hanzo Hattori - ninja serving Ieyasu Tokugawa. In this fictional account, he fights to save his son, Shinzo.\n\n- Jubei Yagyu - similar to other fictional accounts, he is a ronin hired by the Shogunate to execute a demon.\n\n- Genan Shiranui - an eccentric member of the Shiranui clan, he strives to make himself more evil.\n\n- Shiro Tokisada Amakusa - last boss and villain of the game; in this fictional account, he is resurrected years after his death by the demon, Ambrosia. Due to a pact made with the demon, he wants to revive Ambrosia thus destroying the world.\n\n- Kuroko - exclusive playable character in the Game Boy port. He is the background referee who acknowledges the winner of the match, in the GB game he wields two flag blades as his weapon. He did not get a console debut until Samurai Shodown II, in which he imitates moves of several fighters of other SNK games (like Ryo Sakazaki's Haoshokoken). The Game Boy port is the only game where he had his own original moves and weapons unlike his console counterpart.\n\n- Hikyaku - exclusive playable character in the Game Boy port. He is the delivery man running in the background of stages who is forced to disrupt fights by Amakusa.\n\nSAMURAI SPIRITS II:\nSamurai Shodown II is the second game in SNK's popular Samurai Shodown series of versus fighting games. This game has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on August 8, 2008 and in North America on August 25, 2008 at a cost of 900 Wii Points.[It also been released on Xbox 360 for Xbox Live Arcade on September 10, 2008.\n\nSTORY:\nOne of SNK's legendary fighting game series has made a return! In Samurai Shodown II, you can take on one of the roles of 15 warriors as you fight your way through the land to defeat the evil Mizuki! Slash, kick, and slice your opponents in half...do whatever it takes...live by the sword, and die by its blade.\n\nNEW CHARACTERS:\nThe cast of characters was expanded to include the following new additions:\n\n- Genjuro Kibagami, who was to become Haohmaru's greatest rival.\n\n- Cham Cham, a young, catlike girl who was the younger sister of Tam Tam (who was excluded from the game).\n\n- Neinhalt Sieger, a knight from Prussia, who fights with a giant, gun-containing gauntlet.\n\n- Nicotine Caffeine, an old, diminutive monk, and master of Haohmaru and Genjuro.\n\n- Kuroko, the hidden boss of the game, is playable for the first time. Kuroko's movelist is interesting as he uses moves that are used by some of the characters in the game as well as characters from other SNK fighters such as Ryo Sakazaki. His super move in the game is a comical version of Ryo's Ryuko Ranbu.\n\n- Rashojin Mizuki, the first female final boss in the series and the only boss to have assistance from an animal.\n\nManufacturer's description:\n\nHit a record unique in the sense of playing a dynamic action fighting sword play, \"Samurai\"and \"supremacy true Samurai, \" the coupling of the two titles.

It was developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK.\n\nSatomi Hakkenden (usually translated as \"The Eight Dog Chronicles\") was a long-running 19th century novel series about eight samurais from the Sengoku period and their various adventures. It was in some ways partly inspired by the ancient Chinese epic The Water Margin, which has itself seen video game adaptations in the form of the Suikoden games. Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation. Makai Hakkenden Shada for the Turbografx-16, also released in 1989, would be a later adaptation.\n\nThe game itself plays much like Dragon Quest; a common source of inspiration for 8-bit RPGs.

For example, the player cannot increase his ship speed until a speed icon is picked up; additional speed icons further increase the ship velocity.\n\nSeveral weapons, when additionally upgraded, turn into a 'super' weapon for approximately ten seconds. If the player has the ripple laser, and then gets another icon for it, the player will receive the high-powered Buster ripple for a short period of time. Options have been slightly changed with the arrival of 'option seeds', which are small options that orbit the ship firing only the basic initial shot. Two option seeds can combine into one full option. Moreover, options can also be sacrificed to utilize a short-term homing beam weapon.\n\nSeveral enemy bosses typical to Gradius games return, including the Brain Golem (the first level boss) and the Tetran (the second level boss). There are a total of six levels. Since the game is similar to its prequel, Salamander 2 does not use the Revival Start feature from Gradius (which pushes the player back to a pre-determined checkpoint if a life is lost), many people consider this title to be easier than other titles in the Gradius series due to this. Once the game has been completed, it starts its second-loop at a much higher difficulty. The music is also changed to remixed versions of Salamander's music in some stages. The first player's ship is called Vic Viper while the second player's ship is Super Cobra.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":828230400,"platforms":["Arcade","Sega Saturn","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2z0k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"22409","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-22409/"},{"category":14,"store":null,"uid":"20336","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Salamander%202"}]},{"igdb_id":298714,"name":"Salvatorem","summary":"Fight Slavic mythological bosses in this closed-world RPG","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8421.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":28608,"name":"Safari Venture","summary":"Help zoologist Erwin to track down evil poachers and save the animals of the Serengeti National Park!","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["rokaplay"],"publishers":["rokaplay"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1494547200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coazmm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":46183,"name":"Sampras Tennis 96","summary":"Sampras Tennis 96 is a tennis game released exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive.

There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed.\n\nThe popular Pachi-Pro Fūunroku story mode returns with Pachi-Pro Fūunroku 2: Senjukannon no Nazo, a direct sequel to the first installment which picks up the story right where it left off before. The protagonist has just arrived at Shinkai Town, following a lead to find his father's killer. The game proceeds much the same as before, with the player moving between different locations speaking to other characters and playing pachinko. In addition to the three pachinko halls and the player's apartment, there are also now a restaurant and a shrine, where different story events may occur. It is also now possible to learn and use special moves for use in the pachinko battles. As before, it is possible to pursue a relationship with one of five different girls, with the game's ending changing accordingly.","genres":["Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":["Sanyo"],"publishers":["Irem"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1068076800,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co97jk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":100343,"name":"Save Granny","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":95681,"name":"Satay Club mini","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":227774,"name":"Sausage Bundle: Till the last drop of ketchup","summary":"Survive a kitchen massacre solo or with friends!

The gameplay once again mixes heavy doses of survival horror and puzzle-solving with mild combat elements, as players attempt to help themselves, and others, out of life-and-death situations by successfully completing mini-games and quick-time events. The combat comes in two forms, with gamers using melee attacks and a variety of weapons in physical battles against Jigsaw's thugs, or executing puzzle-based attacks that make use of traps and environmental hazards. Various case files are strewn about the hotels, factories, and sewers in which the game is set, and players can also collect a number of Billy the Puppet dolls hidden throughout each level. As was the case with its predecessor, Saw II: Flesh & Blood includes multiple endings based on choices gamers make throughout the story.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Zombie Studios"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":72.5,"release_date":1287446400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3izx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"xbox36066acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024b4e0822","url":"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/SAW-II/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024b4e0822"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"30629","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-30629/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"27604","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/SAW II: Flesh & Blood"}]},{"igdb_id":287451,"name":"Sadey's Sail","summary":"A casual resource management game about Captain Sadey, her trusty ship, and her rapscallion crew sailing the high seas in search of fortune and adventure!","genres":["Simulator","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Pale Moon Games"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1656720000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9fd7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":75447,"name":"Samurai Spirits Zero Special (Unfixed)","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1074124800,"platforms":["Neo Geo AES"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lwaoweoch0fqrarybvc6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":238793,"name":"Sally Can't Sleep","summary":"Sally Summers, an average Jill living in her apartment in L.A, has trouble getting to sleep one night.

When you play Samsara, you pick a hero from a classic FPS game, spawn in the battlefield with abilities and weapons from their original game, and then proceed to lay waste among all those that stand in your way in whatever iwad or levelset of your choice. Each of the heroes are strictly limited to their own weapons, so you won't have a nonsensical random mash-up of people wielding weapons just not suited for them.\nWant to play in Heretic? No problem. Give Chex Quest a whirl? Go right ahead. Wanted to like HeXen but didn't like the low amount of weapons? Go on, enjoy it. Want to go strictly vanilla and play Doom II? Be my guest. Current iwads supported are Doom, Doom II/TNT/Plutonia, Heretic, HeXen, Chex Quest, Strife, and Harmony, and more are to come.\n\nThe goal of Samsara is threefold:\n1: To provide an interesting competitive mod that will enhance, rather than break, deathmatch/capture the flag/etc play. While obviously nothing will match pure vanilla for srs tourney play, if desired one can have a match full of Doomguys and have little to no differences from vanilla play--and someone joining in as Corvus should not dramatically change things.\n2: To stay true to the spirit of classic FPSes by presenting these characters with as close to their original abilities and weapons as reasonably possible. Playing with them should be very much like playing their original game.\n3: To provide a fun experience complimentary with many other levelsets, be they cooperative or competitive, so that people can live as their favorite heroes once again and put them through wringers so many other inventive people have designed. Other heroes should not differ so drastically from Doom II that other mods would now be unplayable.\n\nWhether you play in co-op and tear through endless hordes of monsters or play in deathmatch and tear through whatever friends or enemies challenge you, Samsara offers you the ability to live through your favorite games again on new battlefields or new iwads entirely.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["TerminusEst13"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1340409600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4n6d.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":123686,"name":"Sand Balls","summary":"Make a path for your balls by moving your finger.

Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte Magazine and mailed $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer.[1] Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. For example, the March–April 1979 issue of Recreational Computing describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published.[4]\n\nCommercialization through electronic media\nWhen magnetic media publishing became widely available, a Navy Petty Officer, Paul Lohnes, ported Sargon to the TRS-80, altering both graphics, input, and housekeeping routines leaving the Spracklen's chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: Hayden Software. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software. In the early 1980s SARGON CHESS was ported to several earlier microcomputers, i.e. NASCOM (by Bits & PCs, 1981), Exidy Sorcerer, Sharp MZ 80K,[5] and many others. A complete rewrite was necessary later for the Apple II port, made by Kathleen's brother Gary Shannon. Both were published by Hayden Software.\n\nSequels\nThe Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program[1] and released Sargon II. In 1978 it tied for third at the ninth North American Computer Chess Championship despite being seeded ninth of 12 entries. Sargon finished only behind Belle and Chess 4.7, and defeated AWIT—running on a $5 million Amdahl mainframe—amazing the audience.[6][3][1] That year they published a series of articles in BYTE on computer chess programming,[2][7] stating \"we think it would be nice if not everyone had to reinvent the wheel\".[6]\n\nSargon II was ported to a variety of personal computers popular in the early 1980s.[8] The game engine featured multiple levels of lookahead to make it more accessible to beginning chess players. BYTE in 1980 estimated that Sargon II had a 1500 rating at the highest tournament-time difficulty level, and speculated that it was the best chess program on sale, including dedicated devices.[9]\n\nSargon 2.5, sold as a ROM module for the Chafitz Modular Game System, was identical to Sargon II but incorporated pondering.[10] It received a 1641 rating at the Paul Masson tournament in June–July 1979, and 1736 at the San Jose City College Open in January 1980.[3]\n\nSargon 3.0 finished in seventh place at the October 1979 North American Computer Chess Championship. The competition had improved, but 3.0 drew against Cray Blitz and easily defeated Mychess, its main microcomputer rival. In December 3.0 easily won the second microcomputer championship in London.[3]\n\nIn 1980, the Spracklens' Reversi game finished in first place at a computer tournament at Northwestern University, and in 1981 it finished in third place at the Santa Cruz Open Othello Tournament.[11]\n\nSargon III was a complete rewrite from scratch. Instead of an exchange evaluator, this version used a capture search algorithm. Also included was a chess opening repertoire. This third version was written originally for the 6502 assembler and was commercially published by Hayden Software in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for 68000 assembly, Sargon III was the first third-party executable software for the Macintosh.[1]\n\nAfter the demise of Hayden Software, later chess programs were also released under the name Sargon, including Sargon IV (Spinnaker Software), Sargon V (Activision) and a CD-i title simply named Sargon Chess. The Spracklens concurrently wrote the engines for the dedicated chess computers produced by Fidelity Electronics, which won the first four World Microcomputer Chess Championships.","genres":["Sport","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Commodore Business Machines, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":315446400,"platforms":["Commodore VIC-20","Atari 8-bit","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y5jp2huijh08yv9zlr4m.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":33317,"name":"Samoliotik","summary":"Samoliotik is a stylish shoot-em-up with different enemies, bosses, colour palettes, power-ups, set in different eras.

It was released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. Samurai Warriors: Chronicles introduces several new features not included in prior Samurai Warriors games. While the top screen displays the main game, the bottom screen is used to display maps, KOs, and mission data. A player can switch between four characters during battle, switching the screen to their respective locations as well. Unlike previous titles, where the player chooses a hero and focuses on their story, in Chronicles the player chooses a male (wielding a dai-katana and rifle) or female (wielding dual swords) character which they play as a primary character in every story battle, following their own story and changing around different armies.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Omega Force"],"publishers":["Koei Tecmo Games"],"aggregated_rating":50.0,"release_date":1298678400,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8mzs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12298,"name":"Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends","summary":"Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends is an expansion disc for Samurai Warriors.

This also offers new weapons, items, skills, three new versus modes, a new survival mode, and fixes several problems. A new difficulty level, Novice is also added which is easier than Easy and targeted for beginners.

When fixed, the controls often throw bonus medals that must be quickly collected, before falling to the bottom of the screen.\n\nSwitches and buttons only require one mouse click to be fixed. Wheels and cranks need to be turned around a couple of times to turn off the light. Cords have to be pulled by their handle. Sliders need to be dragged to a red indicator. Strings have to be plucked. Hourglasses need to be turned upside-down to move the sand to the other compartment. Some buttons have doors that open and close over them all the time, requiring precise timing to be pressed. Dials have to be turn to the number indicated in the red light. Gear sticks need to be placed on the correct position, also indicated by a number in the red light. The keypads have a numerical sequence displayed besides the red lights that must be typed in. The piano has a number assigned for each key, and the display shows the numbers of a tune that must be played. The TV has a joystick and a button, and the objective is to move a targeting cross over a square to destroy it.\n\nEach interaction gives a small amount of money that can be spent on power-ups, in a shop between levels. They appear as three yellow buttons on the screen, that help by slowing the game speed and changing other gameplay parameters.

The game draws from Greek mythology and tells the story of Sylphia, a female warrior with a tragic destiny. Her tale starts as she lays fatally wounded in the temple of Athena - merciless monsters have taken over the city and she perished as she desperately tried to protect innocent villagers. The gods, touched by the sincerity of the young woman's devotion and love, decide to give Sylphia another chance... Now turned into a Sylphid with tremendous powers, the female warrior embarks on a long journey of revenge, ready to fight for her homeland. Sylphia starts equipped with a fairly basic fire weapon that can be upgraded in various ways - four different types based on the four basic elements are available throughout the game, from Fire (Red), Air (Green), Water (Blue) and Earth (Brown). Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level). Sylphia consists of eight stages and is single player only.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Compile"],"publishers":["Tonkin House"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":751248000,"platforms":["Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6g8s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245187,"name":"Syrup Drip","summary":null,"genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Hasbro"],"publishers":["Hasbro"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1577750400,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":301950,"name":"SYNC: Since You Never Came","summary":"You have lost the love of your life.

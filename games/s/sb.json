After selecting the preferred riding style between Basic, Arcade, Advanced, Simulation and Extreme, it's possible to adapt the game to each own needs: braking assistance, power braking, front and rear braking at once or separate control, traction control, advanced physics, off track stability control, rider's health, bike damages, tire wear, starting help, automatic transmission, rider position control, official rules, warm up lap, false start penalty, ideal trajectory, riding help.\n\nWhen selecting the Simulation riding model there are many things that need to be taken into consideration: tires wear down, brakes can wear down, the bike can be damaged and the rider can be injured when an accident occurs. It's therefore important to find the best setup for the bike changing suspension setup, handling geometry, braking, chainring length, gear ratio and tire type.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Black Bean Games"],"publishers":["Milestone"],"aggregated_rating":60.0,"release_date":1243555200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation Portable","Xbox 360","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co72ey.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":7180,"name":"SBK X: Superbike World Championship","summary":"SBK-X: Superbike World Championship is a motorcycle racing game developed by Milestone s.r.l. and published by Black Bean Games in 2010.

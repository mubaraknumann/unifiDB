In addition to the mechanics from the previous game, Zero Gravity adds a new gameplay system based around gravity that replaces the predecessor's \"fuel\" system. During the race, performing tricks and other actions will increase a character's Gravity Points, or GP. If players have accrued enough GP by the time they enter certain areas of the track, they will enter a Zero-Gravity Zone, where they can perform one of two maneuvers. A Gravity Dive will create a small black hole that points gravity forward down the track, giving the player a powerful free-fall boost that is further augmented by striking objects in the vicinity that the hole displaces, such as cars or signs. Alternatively, Gravity Control will alter the gravity of the course, allowing players to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas and shortcuts.

Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.\n\nThe player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.\n\nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Nihon Falcom"],"publishers":["Sierra Entertainment","Victor Musical Industries","Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Takeru","Nihon Falcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":566956800,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","PC-8800 Series","Sharp X1","Wii","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","PC (Microsoft Windows)","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","iOS","DOS","MSX2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3c0b.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":14713,"name":"Sociable Soccer","summary":"Remember Sensible Soccer?

Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their stalves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.\n\nPower-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits.

The completed product was inexplicably canceled by Nintendo, and the game's key elements were later developed into Maxis's 1996 PC game release titled SimTunes.\n\nSound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics.

The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge.\n\nPix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai's Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors, where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen, where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game.\n\nBeat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type, B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert, where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives.\n\nIce Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type. This game is a Breakout clone with a few new twists added after a few stages, such as four bats controlled by a single player.\n\nStar Fly is inspired by music boxes, where the player can set a sequence of stars in the sky, to compose a song.

Here, the players race around a race course against the other three characters for a top position in the race. The game's single player mode is Chaos GP, where the player's goal is to win three different circuits (green, yellow and red). Each circuit is made of six different race courses that the player is taken through in succession.\n\nEach race course is composed of a circuit which needs to be completed thrice. The playable characters have rather simple controls, their basic actions being accelerating to move forward, breaking, and moving left or right on the tracks. In tight corners, the player can break while turning in a specific direction, allowing them to drift through the corners. If the player overuses this method though, the playable character starts spinning out of control. Should the player move outside the race tracks, the racer's acceleration will decreases noticeably on the rough terrain. The race track's sidelines also have obstacles that will stop the player altogether if the playable characters crash into them. The player can as well collect Rings along the race tracks to perform special moves unique to each character.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"publishers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":766627200,"platforms":["Sega Game Gear"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ztb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":45840,"name":"Soul Fighter","summary":"Pick the warrior, thief, or wizard, and fight through five huge levels, each with its own boss.

Vietnamese terrorist, Vinh Moc, kidnaps Gabrielle Prescott, the daughter of an American billionaire, who was aboard that plane. Prescott seeks out and hires Major Howard Toliver, an ex-Marine and highly decorated veteran of Vietnam, to gather a team and rescue his daughter. Toliver, who now works as a counsellor in a Los Angeles prison, recruits six men to form his team - all prison inmates who are serving life sentences. The game begins as the well-armed group lands in Vietnamese territory and makes their way through the jungles to find the captive Gabrielle.\n\nThe story moves along by way of interactive video cut scenes in which you must decide whether to talk or shoot.

It is a 3D platformer developed by a group called Sonic Team Junior, using a modified version of the Doom Legacy source port of Doom, to allow for such things as optional analog control and true room-over-room (something not possible in the standard Doom engine), as well as the standard gameplay elements Sonic games are known for. It has been in the works since 1998 and is currently nearing completion, though several parts of the game are still missing.\n\nSonic Robo Blast 2 is closely inspired by the original 2D Sonic games for the Genesis and attempts to recreate a game with this style in 3D, though it also borrows elements from the current Sonic games, such as Sonic's signature Air Spin Attack. Entirely original to SRB2 is its Multiplayer mode, a variation of classic first-person shooter games with Sonic elements. Due to being built with a modified Doom Legacy engine, the game is also very easily customizable. Custom levels, characters and even source code modifications can be created with the help of external editors.","genres":["Platform","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Sonic Team Junior"],"publishers":["Sonic Team Junior"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1154390400,"platforms":["Linux","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","DOS","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6dws.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":95518,"name":"Sokoban for Beginners","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":95559,"name":"Solitaire Beach Season 2","summary":"Exotic getaways in Solitaire Beach Season 2!

Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new, including a jungle environment and a huge airship. Other unique differences are one level that scrolls automatically and one that is aligned vertically instead of horizontally. Most of the enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic's spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are the same as in the Genesis version as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Some of the boss fights differ in the Master System and Game Gear versions of the game, with special designs for the handheld version due to the smaller visible screen area.\n\nSonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Ancient Co., Ltd."],"publishers":["Tec Toy","Sega"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":686880000,"platforms":["Wii","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zuy.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":106392,"name":"Sort the Cube","summary":"Solve the puzzle by sliding the little cubes around","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1533340800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co41sr.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"878510","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/878510"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"786528516","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sort%20the%20Cube"}]},{"igdb_id":106528,"name":"Solitaire Paradise: Tripeaks","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"1415571735","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solitaire-paradise-tripeaks/id1415571735?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"com.bitmango.go.solitaireparadisetripeaks","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitmango.go.solitaireparadisetripeaks"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"298660232","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Solitaire%20Paradise%3A%20Tripeaks"}]},{"igdb_id":106707,"name":"Soosiz HD","summary":"Darkness is falling and your friends are missing.

This extensive community-driven project seeks to redeem the unfulfilled potential of \"Sonic 06\" by meticulously addressing its notorious flaws. The mod dramatically improves the game's core mechanics, rectifying common glitches, camera problems, collision issues, and character physics, resulting in a much smoother and more enjoyable gameplay experience. Beyond mere fixes, \"Legacy of Solaris\" also expands the base game with new missions, levels, and even playable story segments for characters who had limited screen time in the original (such as Blaze, Omega, Knuckles, and Rouge), offering a more comprehensive perspective on the universe and events of \"Sonic 06.\" Furthermore, the mod reintroduces beta elements and concepts that were cut from the final release, providing fans with a glimpse into what the game could have been. While a fan-made endeavor, it also strives to optimize the game for more stable performance, reducing frame drops and, in some cases, delivering visual enhancements. In essence, \"Sonic the Hedgehog: Legacy of Solaris\" takes the foundational story of \"Sonic 06\" – involving time travel, Princess Elise, the villain Mephiles, and the entity Solaris – and meticulously refines it into something genuinely complete and fun.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["HyperPolygon64"],"publishers":["HyperPolygon64"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1604966400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa3gj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":353781,"name":"Soul Slasher","summary":"Soul Slasher is a top down, 1v1 PvP focused close combat game.

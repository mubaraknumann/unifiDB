Kitty's Catch is a two-player game where players control cats named Pitter and Patter, and have to catch fish with their tails. The first player to fill their bucket with fish gets a shell, and the player with the most shells at the end of the time limit wins. There are also several power-ups obtained by collecting tin cans, such as larger hooks.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4zva.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":341712,"name":"Killer Karnival","summary":"Killer Karnival is a first-person survival horror stealth game ​where players are trapped in an abandoned carnival ​and hunted by killer clowns, each with unique senses.

The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours.\n\nProcedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode.Know Your Neighbors.\nIn Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings.\n\nTailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your ship’s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Void’s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel.\n\nBe the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a ‘good guy’? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed.Intense Active Combat.\nTarget enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship.Take Direct Control Of Your\n\nKinetic Void offers three control modes.

In the game, the player controls two green men who carry a cannon, as they defend the king below them from getting abducted by the balloons above, which keep invading the lower part of the screen while also shooting projectiles. Once all the balloons are shot down, the game moves on to the next level.\n\nOne thing that makes King & Balloon unique is that you don't lose a life when hit. Rather, you respawn and keep on playing. The only way to lose a life is letting the king get abducted. Another interesting mechanic of note is that the balloons stop attacking and descending when one grabs ahold of the king, and they will keep still until the king is back on the ground. This creates a risk versus reward mechanic and entices you to let the balloon carry the king high enough so you can take out more balloons, then rescuing the king just in time.\n\nKing & Balloon was also one of the first games to have speech, and it still holds up better than most contemporary or even later examples. The king says \"Help!\" when abducted, \"Thank You!\" when rescued, and \"Bye bye!\" when he leaves the screen. There are actually different voices for the game in Japan and the US version, with the Japan version having a slight Japanese accent.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco","GamePlan"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":341798400,"platforms":["Arcade","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/guf3mn3c3hf6asnwzqc5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":356562,"name":"Kiyo: Bunny Tyranny","summary":"Control the body of Kiyo, a feline ex-predator trapped in a neon-lit, dystopian city dominated by smartphone-addicted bunnies.

The game is neither a remake nor a sequel to the original King's Bounty, but rather it expands on the ideas of its inspiration while adding new, unique elements. Custom EGA graphics that had been made for King's Bounty 2 often draw inspiration from Russian/Slavic folk tales. \n \nThe game isn't shy of its rather clichéd plot. An evil wizard has stolen an important MacGuffin (which isn't even named) from the King, and hid it away in the Dark Castle on a lost continent. The player, taking the role of the King's trusted knight, must find the castle, defeat the wizard and bring the artifact back. Before this can be done however, the continent where the Dark Castle is located must be found. To this end, the player must find five pieces of an ancient map that have been scattered across other continents. Each continent's Lord of the Land might help obtaining a piece of the map, but will request a favour or two in return, and there are other quests to complete on each continent as well. \n \nKing's Bounty 2 was supposed to be split into two parts, with the first concerning the search for the map pieces, and the second would take place on the lost continent. However, apparently only the first part was completed and released to the public. The game had been a free, non-commercial project from the start, so splitting it into parts was not done as a step towards the shareware model, but rather because of free time considerations. \n \nThe game retains many familiar elements from King's Bounty. The player roams the land, buys supplies in towns, hires troops, finds treasure chests, and gets contracts to capture castles in order to earn money and reputation to maintain a large, loyal fighting force. Additionally, the player can buy and sell different goods in towns for a profit, and hire workers to help clear the various terrain obstacles (thus, woodcutters can clear forests, carpenters build bridges over water, stonecutters lay passages through mountains). While there are no player classes in the game, spells can be either found in chests and scrolls, or bought in some of the towns to be used at any time. However, to use magic effectively the player must find a benevolent wizard whose training increases the player's spell power. \n \nThe most common enemies in the game are local feudal lords who are initially neutral to the player but will start chasing and eventually attack when get annoyed by the player's trespassing on their premises. Both the player's and the enemies' armies may consist of a wide variety of creatures, including peasants, mercenaries, soldiers and animals, as well as magical creatures and undead. Each continent has a number of creature dwellings where units can be hired into the player's army. Siege weapons are bought in towns, just like in King's Bounty. Other than direct combat, there are encounters with evil warlocks that can cause trouble for the player, and negative spells in some of the scrolls. \n \nA unique feature of King's Bounty 2 is that it uses a random map generator to create a new world each time it is played. There are four difficulty settings, the first three of which are progressively more difficult \"training\" modes, while the fourth is considered to be the real playing experience. Only the fourth difficulty level was supposed to unlock the lost continent and the final battle with the wizard.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xpgk6hyhq5n6oisup0fj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":54150,"name":"Kings Collection","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":141424,"name":"Killer Station","summary":"A Space Invaders-like game where you control a missile platform and shoot down \"Killer Stations\" while avoiding their missiles.

The Sceptre of Order rested safely in his hands, keeping at bay the forces of darkness that infested the world. Children were happy. Merchants prospered. Honest folks made honest livings. And nobody complained much.\n\nBut far across the waters, Arech Dragonbreath, leader of the Dark Legions, looked enviously upon the wealth and splendor of the four continents. With the aid of great magic, Arech stole into the chambers of King Maximus and wrested the Sceptre from the grip of the sleeping King. He then released his evil forces, ordering his minions and lieutenants to seize the land in whatever manner they pleased (as long as it involved considerable amounts of pain and terror). Arech retired to his new lair on the four continents and waited for King Maximus’s certain resistance. The King and his forces, however, offered none. Fearing some kind of trickery, Arech peered into his prophetic crystal to see what Maximus was up to. The crystal showed the King lying in bed, his face pale and gaunt like death itself.\n\nOver the King stood a noble young knight with the strength and resolve of great leader. The King was speaking. \"Come here\" he gasped, \"I am weak and breath is a luxury. Please.\" He extended his hand and the great leader drew close. \"You must restore my kingdom. I, too, must be restored. I am tied to this land and as it dies, so do I. My days here are numbered. You must recover the Sceptre if I and my land are to live.\"Arech watched this exchange and quickly buried the Sceptre somewhere on the four continents. He draw a map of its location, then shredded it into 25 pieces. He gave one to each of his 16 villainous nobles, kept one for himself, and the other eight he hid with powerful artifacts around the four continents.\n\nYour time grows short, leader. You have your quest and King Maximus’s last hope. May you be guarded in your journey by the Spirits of Order.

The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.\n\nKiller Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced \"auto-doubles\", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents.

Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke, they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.\n\nKing Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Manley and Associates Inc"],"publishers":["Enix America Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":799286400,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xwd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"18768","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18768/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"17199","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/King%20Arthur%20%26%20the%20Knights%20of%20Justice"}]},{"igdb_id":227717,"name":"King Arthur: Knight's Tale - Brigands Skirmish Pack","summary":"Defeat a rebellious band of Brigands in ten uniquely designed skirmish maps, including five difficulty settings.

One day, Shunsuke set out alone to visit his grandparents' house, and on a Saturday morning, he promptly departed. It seems that his neighbor, Mami is coming along with him to the bus stop.\nHowever, there was still some time before the bus arrived, so Shunsuke-kun decided to go to the secret meeting place where he usually gathers with his friends.\nAfter playing there for a while, Shunsuke-kun finally boarded the bus.\nThe next day, when Shunsuke returned he finds not his familiar hometown, but a ruined town of death...\n\nPlayers control the elementary school protagonist, Shunsuke Takano, navigating the transformed 'town' where they live. The game involves defeating three monsters and uncovering hidden mysteries. Aside from the three monsters, be aware of various traps and puzzles. Additionally, choices and actions in the game may lead to the death of other companions. Be cautious and think carefully about your actions to understand the consequences. Even if companions die, the story will continue, but the ending may change slightly.\n\nWhile the initial goal is to defeat the three monsters, the objective may shift along the way. You'll eventually discover the truth behind the story. Admittedly, the content may be divisive, especially considering the horror genre with elementary school protagonists.\n\nEncounters are generally non-existent (only occurring during specific events). The game primarily features event-based battles, and as such, the concept of leveling up is not present.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Parun"],"publishers":["Parun"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1062288000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6xmw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":137266,"name":"Kinoko & Gal","summary":null,"genres":["Platform"],"developers":["8bits Fanatics"],"publishers":["8bits Fanatics"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1381622400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co50hl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":204289,"name":"Kitty Cat Doctor","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":60247,"name":"Killapede","summary":"A Centipede clone published by Players Software for various 8-bit homecomputers.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Players Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536371200,"platforms":["Commodore 16","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ehmeymjkrpvr0n3w9ow6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":45708,"name":"Kick Off 3: European Challenge","summary":"Kick Off 3: European Challenge is a football game developed by Steve Screech for Anco Games as a sequel to Kick Off 2 (which made it to the Sega Mega Drive in the altered form of Super Kick Off).

Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly.

This game was the first of its kind which allowed the player to interact in an entirely original 2.5D world, and can be credited as the game that started graphic adventure gaming on the PC. Though the original AGI parser-based version is outdated and primitive-looking by today's gaming standards, in 1984 it was revolutionary. King's Quest I was not only groundbreaking, but also history in the making. It was followed by seven sequels bearing the King's Quest title.\n\nIn 1990, Sierra released a remake of King's Quest I, taking advantage of newer technology and graphics (using their SCI engine, 16 color EGA graphics, sound card, and mouse support). Unfortunately, this version ended up being a total market failure. As a result, it was highly unlikely that Sierra ever had thoughts of making an even further updated Point-and-Click version of King's Quest I to match later games in the series. This is where we at AGDI decided to step in. Our aim was to remake King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown to the same level of quality as seen in Sierra's King's Quest V. We believe that the enhanced gaming experience for fans has justified our months of unpaid hard work.\n\nOur understanding is that the big companies stopped focusing on the adventure genre because, given the huge budget required to produce adventure games, it didn't prove as lucrative as other genres which were faster and cheaper to develop. Yet, we're hoping that by bringing back such classics adventure titles, we can prove that there is still huge fan interest in Point-and-Click adventure games and a successful market out there. This is our contribution to try to bring classic adventure games, as we used to know them, back to public attention, providing an alternative gaming experience for players who prefer to use their brains to solve puzzles over quick reflexes.\n\nDuring the first month of AGDI releasing our King's Quest I remake in August, 2001, over 5,000 copies were downloaded! In the first year, that number jumped to nearly half a million. The first add-on voice pack was downloaded hundreds of times in a period of just a few days, and thousands of times over the span of several months! It's obvious that there are still numerous adventure gaming fans, around the world, yearning to play more titles from this fantastic genre. AGDI's King's Quest I remake, and all of our future projects, are our gift to the fans of the adventure gaming community.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":["Tierra Entertainment"],"publishers":["Tierra Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":997142400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3og3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":295092,"name":"Kinny and the Lost Starlight","summary":"Kinny and the Lost Starlight is a roguelike deck-building game inspired by tic-tac-toe, where your goal is to light up the cosmos by calling stars to the board and defeating your enemies.","genres":["Strategy","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co80np.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":41261,"name":"Kick Challenger Air Foot Yasai no Kuni no Ashi Senshi","summary":"You control the tomato by independently directing his two feet, one foot at a time.

The first Gundam production not set in the continuity established in the 1979 original series of the franchise, G Gundam presents a world in which global conflicts are settled in a yearly tournament fought between Gundam mecha, each representing its nation's qualities (and stereotypes). Naturally, this premise was adapted into a one-on-one fighting game.\n\nThe game includes 10 different Gundams (one of which can only be selected by players via a secret code), each with its own arena and background music. Four different playing modes are on offer:\nStory Battle allows a limited selection of only five Gundams (the members of the Shuffle Alliance in the series), presenting a series of nine matches against all other Gundams in the game. All matches consist of only one round.\nVersus Battle is for two-player matches. Players choose their Gundam, its pilot (different pilots have different attributes regarding performance, defence and speed) and arena. Both players can select the same Gundam (with the exception of the secret character) and pilot. Matches are best-of-three. Handicaps can be set for each player.\nChampionship Battle is similar to Story Battle, but is in best-of-three mode, allows Gundam selection from the full roster and lacks story sequences.\nTeam Battle is a team-based two-player mode. Players select between one to five Gundams per team. One-round matches follow, with the loser being removed from the roster until only one team remains.\nControls involve the four face buttons for weak and strong punches and kicks, and the two shoulder buttons for quick forward or backward dashes. Each Gundam has its own special moves triggered via input combinations, including extra powerful \"desperation attacks\", which can only be activated if the Gundam's life bar has been significantly lowered and flashes red.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Pandora Box"],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":788486400,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8b9f.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":100971,"name":"Kick The Buddy - The Funny Kick Game","summary":"Come and join the super fun game and relieve stress every day for a while","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":215551,"name":"Kitten's Head Football","summary":"No way, the game with kittens and football?

A+ sold 7,000 copies of the game3, which wasn't that bad for a Korean game in 1993, but even then most reviews weren't that favorable because of a number of flaws. \n \nFirst and foremost stands the obfuscated design, that often leaves players not knowing what they are even expected to do. Then there's the overly simple and boring combat system, especially due to the lack of a party, which really limits the tactical depth. The rest is done by a fair share of bugs and glitches, as well as some more incomprehensible decisions like having an option to throw away items permanently while pretty much everything picked up except weapons and armor is quest-related.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xkd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":319458,"name":"Honkai: Star Rail - Annals of Pinecany's Mappou Age","summary":"Version 2.6 of Honkai: Star Rail, which includes:\n• New character: Rappa\n• New area: Penacony Paperfold University College\n• New Trailblaze Continuance: Banana Outrage: Battles Without Ninja and Humanity\n• …and more!","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["HoYoverse","Cognosphere"],"publishers":["HoYoverse","Cognosphere"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1729641600,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8xae.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":214440,"name":"Hogwarts Legacy: Digital Deluxe Edition","summary":"Hogwarts Legacy is an immersive, open-world action RPG set in the world first introduced in the Harry Potter books.

The game consists of side-scrolling levels where the player must reach the goal while defeating numerous enemy grunts and sub-bosses along the way, each leading to a one-on-one battle with the stage's boss. Despite featuring similar gameplay, this game is unrelated to Toei's video game version of Hokuto no Ken for the Family Computer released a few months later. The game's lead programmer was Yuji Naka, who would later be known for his work on the Sonic the Hedgehog game franchise. Despite appearing on the cover artwork, Rei does not actually appear in this game.\n\nThe original Mark III version game is included along with an enhanced remake in Sega Ages 2500 Hokuto no Ken for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The game was later re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on February 26, 2008. An overseas version of the game was produced for the western Master System titled Black Belt, which lacked the Hokuto no Ken license of the Japanese version and featured altered graphics as a result.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"publishers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Sega"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":522201600,"platforms":["Wii","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7e7v.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":186698,"name":"Horror & Sports Pinball","summary":"Enjoy 6 games in one with the perfect reproduction of real pinball machines, with all kinds of graphic details and sounds.

It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in South Korea and Japan). Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance. The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although some regional variations use a different number of tiles. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four groups (melds) and a pair (head). There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, stolen from another player and thus melded, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and honours (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds, and the order of dealing and play. However there are many regional variations in the rules; in addition, the scoring system and the minimum hand necessary to win varies significantly based on the local rules being used. This game is the digital rendition of Mahjong.","genres":["Puzzle","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"publishers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["SG-1000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7e8b.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12145,"name":"Horror Zombies from the Crypt","summary":"As you take your first tentative steps beyond the decaying entrance gates of the Valdemar estate, your senses are alerted to an unknown fearful presence.

To change direction you have to pull into a opening and reverse out in the new direction. The town itself is split into two parts and they are connected by an Expressway where you watch a small animated piece of your car driving along the road. Each part of town is made up of various buildings and some buildings can be drove into to either keep your car running smoothly or participate in various mini games. The buildings you encounter are:\n\nCar Wash: You just watch your car going through the various stages of a car wash.\n\nGas Station: You control the mechanic and you can fill the car up with gas and check the tyre pressures.\n\nTuning: Here you watch your car having the engine tuned.\n\nOil Change: You control another mechanic and once you raised the car you must move a drum below the car and try to catch all the drops of oil dripping from the car without making a mess. Once the engine is empty you can fill the car with oil.\n\nDemolition Derby: You view a square track from above with the whole track on screen as you drive around the track. You attempt to smash the other cars to destroy them while avoiding being smashed yourself.\n\nFirefighting. Pulling into the fire station allows you to drive a fire engine along the road looking for any buildings on fire. Once you find a burning building you must park beside a fire hydrant.

Born November 15, 1939, Naito has been a professional Shoji player since he was 18 years old. In addition to helping with this video game, Naito Kudan is a published author, having 13 books written about Shoji and running a column in the sports section of the newspaper. He is also a published singer but mostly does it as a hobby. In 2010 Naito was honored with the Order of the Rising Sun, twin Mitsuaki, the fifth highest honor a citizen can receive in Japan.\n\nHonshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden, follows the standard rules of Shoji (Japanese Chess). There is no ability to change the difficulty or handicap. Most of the screen is the Shoji board, but there is also a representation of the player and computer playing Shoji in a Japanese setting, which moves as the game moves.

It served as a tie-in to the anime series of the same name, being released a few days after the airing of its fifth episode. A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released by Taxan in North America under the title of Fist of the North Star on April 1989, making it the earliest Hokuto no Ken tie-in product released outside Japan. Before release, the NES version was shown in the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in 1988 under the title of Ken the Great Bear Fist, Toei's proposed localized title for the series.\n\nBecause the game was produced at the same time as the Hokuto no Ken 2 anime series entered production, certain plot details differ from both, the manga and anime. Most notably, the renegade Gento Kō Ken masters from the anime, Taiga and Boltz, co-exists as enemy characters alongside Jakō's sons from the manga, Jask and Sheeno, while Bronza, a character exclusive to this game, serves as the General of the Red Light in place of Shoki, who filled the same role in the anime. While Shoki himself never appears in the game, his death at the hands of Sheeno is acknowledged in the official strategy guide. The game only covers the Tentei story arc, with a bonus stage featuring the Nameless Asura as a hidden final boss.","genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Shouei System"],"publishers":["Toei Animation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":545616000,"platforms":["Family Computer","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8o71.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":40348,"name":"Hole Land","summary":"Destroy all the enemies that pop out of the ground.

It was inspired by events that happened in the United States during 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn the near future, thanks to perpetual infighting, the US Government lost it's ability to keep society stable. The land that once was the United States got divided into various mini-states, thanks to a period of conflict known as The Second Civil Wars.\n\nThe 96 governments that formed in its place, raging in size from cities to multiple former states, come in many forms: Some feudal, some neo-liberal, some communist, some tribal, and many theocratic.\n\nYou are in the now renamed District of Artema, a \"solarpunk\" society surrounded by less stable states.\n\nYou play as a refugee, either male or female, assigned to a household of three women, one who lost loved ones in the war, one whose family split apart by war, and one who works in the government. Getting along with your roommates is a major part of the game.\n\nYou can play as the player character from Date Ariane and Something's In The Air, or as the player character from Ariane in Paradise or play as a brand new character.\n\nMany jobs have been automated, limiting jobs to those sectors that can’t be automated, most of which are part time. Finding a job you like is another major part of the game.\n\nThe final act involves a crisis to be averted, but only if you make the right connections and get your roommates to cooperate.\n\nOf course this is also an erotic visual novel, with the usual amounts of satirical comedy, nudity, and sex spread throughout the narrative. As with all my games, I am constantly trying to reinvent the genre.","genres":["Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["ArianeB"],"publishers":["ArianeB"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1663113600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa88z.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":29905,"name":"Hollow Halls","summary":"Hollow Halls is a short indie horror game, focusing on story and atmosphere over combat and action.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1484784000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2bmx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":297656,"name":"Hong Gildong-jeon 2","summary":"Hong Gildong-jeon 2 is an interactive cartoon in the vein of Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8324.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":156658,"name":"Hopeless Dregs","summary":"Hopeless Dregs is a turn based roguelike game.

You-Know-Which series - further enhanced with strategy and RPG elements. The core of the gameplay is based on ship-to-ship dogfights, combined with assaults on giant spaceships (such as the Siegfried-Class Zeppelins), as well as tactical thinking and resource management.\n\nThe game is set in outer space, where the players must defend the Earth from the invasion of the Moon Nazis. The players control spaceships to freely roam the space and attack Nazi vessels; various weapons and equipment are at their disposal, from laser cannons and missiles to handy drones and satellites which can be launched from certain ships. The vessels are also equipped with military countermeasures, to protect them from enemy fire.\n\nThe players can access a tactical map of outer space to spot the positions of Nazi forces or any ongoing battles, and thus instantly know where to fly. The ultimate goal is to destroy the secret Nazi base hidden on the Dark Side of the Moon and to keep the Earth safe from the invading spacecraft.\n\nBeing based on the cult movie, the “Iron Sky: Invasion” comes with a touch of politics as well: various nations will offer unique missions, yet to accept or refuse them is up to the player. Some missions tempt the players with special rewards, such as precious upgrades or even brand new ships.\n\nThe players can dock at an allied space station to recharge weapons, purchase upgrades or even switch ships. Almost all spaceships that appear in the film can be controlled in game (except for the largest one), including the South-Korean scout ship “Zerg”, the Australian bomber “Dundee”, or the UK fighter “Spitfire”. The availability of some will depend on the completion of certain missions.\n\nThe ships’ sub-systems can be further upgrade in the hangar: for example, upgrading the offensive systems will increase the number of weapons and boost their power, while an engine upgrade will improve the ship’s speed and range of interception. Upgrades require special resources, which can be scavenged from destroyed enemy units or found in outer space.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Reality Pump"],"publishers":["TopWare Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1355270400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2duj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":330859,"name":"Iron Convoy","summary":"Iron Convoy is a turn-based tactical survival game set in a brutal post-apocalyptic world.

No longer recognized due to the changes in their DNA, the O'Brien's security robot, simply known as \"the Ship's Defender\", assumes they are invaders and kills them. An apparent technical malfunction has caused the O'Brien's computer to believe that it was in a real life war situation, and select the planet Calliope as a target for destruction. Like all of the human fleet's Cerberus-class destroyers, the O'Brien carries a weapon known as \"Iron Helix\", which is capable of destroying all life on a planet in a single act. An attack on Calliope, a peaceful Thanatosian planet, would cause the war to go \"hot\".\n\nThe player is on board the scientific exploration ship Indiana, and is contacted by the Earth's forces in an attempt to stop the O'Brien, as it was the only ship nearby. As the ship is infected with the unknown virus, the player instead remotely controls a zoological robot that is sent over to explore. As much of the ship's systems are locked out using DNA detectors, the robot must collect uncontaminated samples of the crew's DNA to access different secured areas on board. The robot can also interface with dataports on the O'Brien to operate its systems, from opening doors to issuing executive commands.","genres":["Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Drew Pictures"],"publishers":["Spectrum HoloByte, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Sega CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6dis.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"20305","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-20305/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"18564","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Iron%20Helix"}]},{"igdb_id":120701,"name":"Iris In Fantasy","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co46gh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":14794,"name":"Iron Warriors: T-72 Tank Command","summary":"The most devastating mechanized armor to ever roll onto a battlefield is brought to life in Iron Warriors: T72-Tank Command.

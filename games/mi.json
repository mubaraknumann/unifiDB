Midgard Outlaw uses the same weapons and enemies from Project Einherjar, but adds several new foes, as well as a dynamic music gimmick: the soundtrack is comprised of ogg vorbis instead of midi, and switches from calm to intense at certain points during each mission.

It was released as a sequel to Data East's earlier success, Side Pocket. The objective is to travel through different cities and defeat AI-controlled hustlers. The player can also take on another human player in order to prove his worthiness at the pool table.\n\nThe player can participate in a story mode and play against a set of pros in six different pool halls in an attempt to face off against Minnesota Fats himself. There are seven different variations of pool to play: Eight-Ball, Nine-Ball, Rotation, 14-1 rack, Three ball, Cut Throat & One Pocket. There is also a Versus Mode to let players take on any opponent of their choice including a two-player option to take on a friend and a Tournament Mode. Players can also try out the Trick Mode that has the player try to compete 16 different trick shots.\n\nThe Saturn version of the game largely plays the same as the Genesis version, but includes a training mode, a short documentary on Minnesota Fats, and a completely different plot in the story mode. In the Genesis version, the player takes the role of an unnamed rookie pool player seeking to challenge Minnesota Fats, and cutscenes are computer-animation. In the Saturn version, the player takes the role of Minnesota Fats himself, in his quest to challenge fictional pool hustlers from around the United States; live-action, full-motion videos (FMVs) are used for the cutscenes.\n\nIn Japan, the title Side Pocket 2 is only used in the Saturn version, whereas the Genesis version retains the Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend title.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Data East"],"publishers":["Data East"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":796608000,"platforms":["Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3wda.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":358026,"name":"Mining Heroes: Puzzle RPG","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1726272000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa719.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":29865,"name":"Mighty Party","summary":"Lead your MIGHTY PARTY to victory!

The game consists of six stages, with the first two stages and the final one covering events from the film, whereas Stage 3 to 5 are set before the events of the film and adapts key episodes from the TV show's second season (namely \"White Light\", \"Ninja Encounter\", and \"Power Transfer\"). The game's soundtrack, composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, features hard rock arrangements of Ron Wasserman's original TV themes.\n\nThe game contains a total of nine rangers: Tommy, Adam, Kimberly, Billy, Aisha, Rocky, Zach, Trini, and Jason. When selecting Jason, Zach, and Trini, the voice clips of Adam, Aisha, and Rocky are heard when calling out their respective Zord name as their morphing command. The reason for this is because the original actors for them were released from contract after the events of the Power Transfer two-parter episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Sega and Banpresto asked for permission from Saban Entertainment to use their characters but have the three replacements use their voices instead of Jason, Trini, and Zach. There are cinematic scenes in digitized form that are abridged from the movie and some from Season 2 of the show. Lord Zedd, Goldar, the Putty Patrol, and Oozemen appear as sub-enemies. Nimrod the Scarlet Sentinel, AC, and DC are renamed in this title as Sentinel Neck, Sentinel Ear, and Sentinel Ring respectively.

A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.\n\nSpring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.\n\nLineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.\n\nFinty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.\n\nColor Collision. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time. The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.\n\nRat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.\n.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Microsoft","Alexey Pajitnov"],"publishers":["Classified Games","Swing!

You just got your paycheck from your degrading part time cashier job. A whopping 55 dollars and 62 cents. With your new found riches, you decide to hit up some local garage sales to see if you can get a good deal on any retro games. These relics, forgotten by time, remind you of a simpler world. A world of play, of laughter, joy, excitement. Concepts that are becoming more and more unfamiliar to you with each passing day that you waste away at that fucking cash register.\n\nYou climb into your beat up 2007 Saturn Ion with the rear bumper held on by ductape, and drive, stopping at each location to see what they have to offer. Clothes, books, kids toys, but no games. This average Saturday afternoon has now devolved into a disappointing Saturday evening. With the orange glow of the setting sun enveloping you in despondency, you decide to make one last stop before calling it a day. You step out of the car, hopes lower than ever, to see more of the same. Tables of neatly folded clothes, boxes of old VHS tapes, dusty dinnerware, miscellaneous knick-knacks.\n\nAs you're heading back to the car, something out of the corner of your eye catches your attention. A lone Playstation 1 game, resting atop a plastic tote full of bed sheets. With the glare of the sun reflecting off of its plastic jewel case, you can't quite make out what game it is, but you can tell it's a 3 disc game by the thickness of the case. You wonder which game it could be. Alone in the Dark? Final Fantasy? Chrono Cross? Curiosity now at its peak, you find yourself reaching for the alluring game.\n\nYour curiosity has now twisted into total confusion. Now holding the game in your cold, clammy hands, you read the title, speaking it out loud. \"Minecraft: Playstation Edition\". As these words leave your lips, you feel a chill run down your spine. \"How can this be?\", you think to yourself. \"Minecraft wasn't created until 2009. By then, even the Playstation 3 was already 3 years old. This is impossible. Surely this is a fake, or a homebrew, or...something?\"\n\nFlipping the game over, you take a gander at the rest of the case. At first glance, all appears to be normal. It has a rating, a barcode, gameplay screenshots, even a SLUS number. But upon further inspection, you notice the text on the back of the case. It's not English. In fact, it's no language that you've ever seen before, to your recollection. Strange, indeed.\n\nYou tear your eyes away from the case. It's getting dark out. The owners of the house have begun packing up their unsold items, and most of the customers have gone home. You glance back down at the game to see the price sticker. $15. \"Should I?\", you ponder. 15 dollars is a sizeable amount for someone in your position. Why spend this much for something that might not even work? But you can't just let something this unusual go, you have to know what it is or it will haunt you for the rest of your life.\n\nFor the first time, you open the case. You see the first disc: Overworld. Next to it appears to be the game manual. You open it, but the pages are all torn out. \"Why would someone do this?\" Shoving the thought aside, you close the empty housing of what presumably once was an instruction booklet, and open the second compartment of the case, revealing the other two discs: The End, and The Slip. \"The Slip? Is that supposed to be The Nether?\" Shrugging off your confusion, you question the integrity of the game. All the discs are there, but in what condition? You check the shiny, black underside of each disc for scratches, but they are minimal.\n\nYou take one last look at your surroundings. Nobody has noticed you. In what is not your proudest moment, you close the case, shove it into the pocket of your hoodie, and as you do, you feel a sudden sense that someone or something is watching you. You spare a quick glance over your shoulder. Nothing. You briskly leave the scene, shuffle into your car and start the engine.\n\nUpon arriving at your humble abode, you slam the door behind you, startled by the sound. It seems to have snapped you out of your daze, bringing you to a more conscious state of mind. It's a very familiar feeling. The same feeling you experience every time you wake up. Your surroundings slowly become more real to you. You slowly become more self aware. Your clothes are damp from sweat, your vision is blurrier than normal, you don't even remember the drive home. It's as if you... teleported.\n\nLooking around the room, not quite sure what you're looking for, your eyes stop once they reach the clock on the wall. 11:57. \"What the fuck...\" Not so much a question that begs for an answer, but rather a simple declaration of bewilderment. You toss your keys in the direction of the table, not caring whether they land on it or not.\n\nYou open the mysterious case, remove the Overworld disc, and place it into your Playstation console, close the lid, and press the power button. A procedure you've done so many times before, but this time, it doesn't feel so comforting. You are welcomed by the notoriously eerie startup sequence of the PS1, proceeded by a large spinning grass block accompanied by the word Loading... You feel yourself become increasingly more uneasy as the block continues to spin, and spin, and spin, and as it does so, you feel yourself starting to slip away.\n\nBefore you have time to process this feeling, it stops, and the title screen presents itself to you. \"Minecraft: Playstation Edition\". There are 3 buttons: Play, Options, and Quit Game. Next to these options, a graphic of Steve. His eyes seem to pierce through yours, looking directly into your soul. But it's just a picture...right? The background, while perhaps unintentional, is intangibly disturbing. It appears to be some kind of mansion, expertly built, nonetheless, in a dark and foggy setting.\n\nYou press play, proceeding to the World Select screen. To your surprise, there is already one world: Tutorial. You're no stranger to Minecraft, so you ignore it, eagerly jumping straight to the Create New World button. Most of the standard world creation options seem to be there, along with a virtual keyboard. You use it to name your world, then you set your gamemode, world type, difficulty, and with the controller ever so slightly trembling in your hands, you hesitate just for a second. Curiosity, anxiety, excitement, fear. All of these emotions hit you like a punch to the stomach. Your breath stops. The clock strikes 12. \"Preparing for world creation.

The hero of the game, Jack, must make his way through 16 levels of a pyramid in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family.Each level is split into two parts an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from the games prequel, Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the games timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.To prevent the player from becoming too greedy, the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the games timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the torture room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.A Royal Palace room NES version.A Vs.

In the NES version, Jack could warp forward to the next Royal Palace room if he touched the first lit bomb in the current room after the other 23 bombs were collected however, if Jack died in the warping process, he would be sent back to the beginning of the level from which the trick commenced.Mighty Bomb Jack also had a guest appearance on Tecmo Super Bowl, during the halftime show in the Super Bowl","genres":["Platform","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Tecmo"],"publishers":["Elite Systems","Tecmo Koei Games","Tecmo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":514684800,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","Nintendo 3DS","Wii","Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga","Family Computer","Wii U","Nintendo Entertainment System","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ss9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":278988,"name":"Mining Mechs: Magnetic Mystery","summary":"Explore a brand new map and storyline set in the Arctic!

This game transforms basic curiosity into powerful thinking.\n\nMinDStorm, from developer ASK Co. Ltd., takes brain exercise software to a new level and offers a whole raft of exciting new games, features and challenges all designed specifically to stimulate and improve the player's brain functions and most importantly, be fun to play in their own right.\n\nTransform gaming curiosity into powerful thinking with MinDStorm. The game features ten distinct types of challenge for players, all of which are simple to pick up and play using the Nintendo DS stylus, touch screen and microphone. Each of MinDStorm's challenges is designed to focus on enhancing the player's reason, endurance, analysis, intuition or observation. Regardless of the type of game chosen, extended play results in improved overall brain function and enhanced memory.\n\nA first for the brain training genre, MinDStorm throws additional challenges and problems into the mix. Players are rewarded with ever more complex riddles to solve as they do well in the main training mode. General knowledge and geography-based challenges are also included to accompany the more abstract trials such as sliding picture puzzles, mazes to navigate with the stylus and spot the difference games.\n\nFurther innovation is found in the way the game will adapt the tasks it asks players to perform according to the local environment it is being played in. When playing on a bumpy car or train ride for instance, MinDStorm will omit the tasks that require precise stylus action. When playing in public the game will spare players the need to vocalize into the Nintendo DS microphone.

Miis are arranged on a grid of three forward facing weapons and one rear weapon, which can be rotated to shoot in multiple directions, with additional Miis powering up the main weapons when placed behind them on the grid. If the player is hit, one of the Miis will be forced to retreat, and the game ends if the player loses all of their Miis. After completing the main campaign, players unlock Arcade mode, which tasks players with clearing the campaign on one run. The game also features leaderboards, encouraging players to beat scores set by people encountered on StreetPass.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Good-Feel"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1371513600,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co854t.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":374163,"name":"Missing","summary":"\"Missing\" is a first-person horror adventure game set in 1970s Hong Kong.

A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector. The object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married. The obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again. The most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown.

The game consists of two different soccer simulations, you can carry out a match in the stadium or indoors. The field is always shown from the top and scrolled softly into all directions. The player that is controlled at the moment can be recognized by a flickering football shirt. If you have the ball you can pass or shoot. The longer you keep the fire button pressed, the sharper the shot will be. Additionally, the trajectory bends if the joystick is pressed to the left or right. If the opponent has the ball, you can try to take it away from him with a sliding tackle. When the own keeper gets visible, you take over his controls and a press on the fire button makes the keeper jump.\n\nIndoor soccer has some fundemental changes to the rules. The ball cannot roll into the out, but it bounces from the cushion. Furthermore, the keeper can be the goalgetter himself (in contrast to the stadium where he is limited to the penalty area).\n\nIf a goal is scored, the scene is repeated in slow motion and one can watch the attack unhurriedly. Extensive and clearly arranged menus enable you to change many parameters of \"Microprose Soccer\". These range from the length of a match (2 to 12 minutes) to details of the controls. Also the weather can be changed and by this you can get a proper rain shower during the game by coincidence. With a wet ground the ball rolls further and the players sometimes slip.\n\nDifferent game modes make for diversity. Up to 15 players can enter their names and then compete with each other in a league. One can also take part in a World Cup, whereby the venue corresponds to the one of a real World Cup. The computer takes over the controls of as many teams as needed. The strengths of the teams correspond approximately to the real national teams (random exceptions can happen). Scores can be saved any time and additionally there is a \"Name Bank\", a database with names of clubs, but there is limited memory, 16 clubs can be created.

This began his lifelong fascination with video games and computers. Even though the family had an Atari 2600, Ryan and his brothers were drawn to the Intellivision and its more complex games. \n \nBy 1992, the family Intellivision had long since died, but Ryan started to discover that thrift stores and garage sales were loaded with old video games. For little money, he was able to build what a decade earlier would've been the video game collection of any kid's dreams. Ryan had become an Intellivision fanatic again. \n \nAs we rolled into the new millennium, the feasibility of programming the Intellivision became possible. A handful of individuals managed to create compilers, emulators, documentation, and development hardware of the Intellivision. Ryan's attention was peaked in 2000 when Joe Zbiciak programmed an entirely new game, 4-Tris, and then managed to build and sell it as a complete package. \n \nIn 2002 Ryan found a lot of spare time to start dabbling with Intellivision programming. After experimenting with a variety of \"Hello World\" programs and learning the various features of the Intellivision one by one, Ryan adopted a Minesweeper clone as the theme of his first full game attempt. \n \nRyan chose to do MineHunter for the following reasons: \n \n1) MineHunter is a proven concept. Creating an entirely new game concept is always a risky venture and requires a greater investment of time. (This is why you see so many clones of popular games.) \n \n2) MineHunter is not very difficult to program since it requires little or no animation. (This belief changed when Ryan added the explosion routine.) \n \n3) The game concept had always been a favorite of him. Every time he came across it, he would find himself addicted again. \n \n4) MineHunter is well suited for the Intellivision's display capabilities. MindStrike for the Intellivision ECS proved that it's feasible to make a screen full of numbers look good. \n \n \nThe majority of MineHunter was programmed over the course of about 9 months from mid 2002 to early 2003. The game was about 95% finished when suddenly all of Ryan's free time had disappeared. In addition, his interest in programming the Intellivision was starting to wane due to realization that it may be impossible to ever build and sell games. Some brief research showed Ryan that building actual cartridges and producing the associated manuals, boxes, and overlays would be insanely expensive and require an immense amount of time. \n \nRyan's Intellivision programming work was falling farther and farther to the backburner when in late 2003 he was approached by the Chris Neiman and David Harley about the possibility of making MineHunter into an actual cartridge. Over 2003 and 2004 they put a lot of effort, research and investment into working out a plan that would allow for the production of new games to be published just like the originals were 20 years ago. Their efforts encouraged him to complete the programming of MineHunter in 2004.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1044057600,"platforms":["Intellivision"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pid.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":105087,"name":"Miami Cruise","summary":"Miami Cruise is a game inspired by retrowave aesthetics.

The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.\n\n- Programmed Trip is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button.

Exploring the factory takes players to a variety of locations including the lobby, platform room, atrium, maintenance room, cafeteria, security booth, conference room, elevator, trash room, pipe room, tentacle room, contamination room, R&D lab, pressure control room, locker room, mailroom and more.\n\nDuring the adventure, players interact with characters from the film, including Delta, Boo, Fran, Smitty, Needleman, Skip, and Wally. In addition to solving puzzles, kids are required to complete simple tasks like finishing Mike's paperwork, exploring every room in the factory to find joke cards, and maintaining a small inventory. Joke cards are used by Mike to match specific types of jokes, categorized by sports, animals, science, food, music, family, transportation, school, monsters and clown routines, with certain kids to make them laugh.\n\nUpon completion of the first puzzle, a blueprint becomes available that shows the missing machine parts as well as a list of items that have been found. After Mike rescues Boo early in the game, players gain access to the Cereal Slide mini-game where the goal is to become the first player to line up colored cereal pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally in a row of three (3x3 grid) or four (5x5 or 7x7 grids).

Billy and Kimberly return from the previous game along with the introduction of Tommy, as the White Ranger (opposed to appearing as Green Ranger), three new rookie rangers, Rocky, Adam, and Aisha, who replaces Jason, Zack, & Trini from the original game.\n\nThe player begins each stage as his or her character's civilian persona. The player can fill up a \"Morphing meter\" next to their life gauge by picking up thunderbolt-shaped items (whether by small bolts or morphing sign bolts). These items are dropped by enemies and can also be used to perform a special attack when the character is morphed in Ranger Mode. A Special code made for the game can have the players begin the stages as the morphed Rangers instead of their civilian persona. Once the Morphin' meter is filled, the player can press the special attack button to morph; an animated sequence begins showing the rangers morphing in a digitized video (Based of the Season 2's transformation without showing the Red Ranger helmet configuring at the end). The method also occurs automatically after the player goes throughout the mission in civilian mode encountering the boss triggering the morph sequence (regardless of how much energy of the morphin' meter is filled up).\n\nThe game consists of seven stages. The player fights against Lord Zedd's Putty Patrol until reaching the end of stage boss. The first five bosses are all monsters from the TV show's second season, while the sixth one is an original creation for the game. The final boss is Ivan Ooze, the film's antagonist. Unlike the first game, there are no giant robot battles in this version, although the Ninja Megazord from the film (and the show's third season) makes an appearance during the ending sequence.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Natsume Co., Ltd."],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":804470400,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co63o3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":712,"name":"Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight","summary":"As the name suggests, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight, is that year's version of the popular simulator from Microsoft and celebrates 100 years of flight.

Part of the Punch-Out!! series, it is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (particularly the latter) with some variations.\nPunch-Out!! features a boxer known as Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version.\nLittle Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the uppercut, the player needs to press the start button once a star is earned. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard.\nLittle Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking/dodging the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge or block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up.\nA bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate higher than a certain point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down (different boxers require different point totals to win by decision). However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout.\nWhen Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings - one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.","genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"developers":["Nintendo R&D3"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":561513600,"platforms":["Arcade","Family Computer","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6386.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":329482,"name":"Mike Shadow: I Paid For It!","summary":"Mike shadow is an action and combat game, where a vending machine swallowed your money and you must fight it with dozens of special attacks with high animation quality.

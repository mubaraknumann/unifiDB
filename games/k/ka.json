Unlike the first game, Kagero: Deception II is played from a third-person perspective. A major addition to the gameplay is the introduction of \"trap combos\": traps can be positioned in such a way that they will trigger each other, leading to powerful combinations that would harm the invaders more. The game also allows to customize traps and use various materials to build new ones. As before, the main character and her traps grow in power in correspondence with the amount of enemies killed, lending the game a RPG flavor.\n\nThe morality system also present in this sequel, as the player can decide for Millennia whom to kill and whom to spare.

The game exhibits a combination of a side-scrolling platform and fighting game elements. The player uses punches and kicks to defeat Akuma and his guards and make his way deeper into the fortress. The game, as with most at the time of development, lacked checkpoints or the ability to save the game, making it a challenge to complete in a single sitting.\n\nKarateka has been well-received, particularly for its realistic animations used for the game's characters. The game was considered a breakthrough success for Mechner, and would eventually result in his development of the Prince of Persia franchise. A high-definition remake, spearheaded by Mechner, was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, with planned ports for the iOS and Wii U systems.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Jordan Mechner"],"publishers":["Brøderbund Software","Dro Soft","Soft Pro International","Atari Corporation","DotEmu"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["Atari 7800","Atari 8-bit","PC-9800 Series","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Android","Atari ST/STE","iOS","DOS","Apple II","Family Computer","Amstrad CPC","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2njq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":4947,"name":"Kamen Rider: Climax Heroes","summary":"Kamen Rider: Climax Heroes is a 3D crossover fighting game featuring the heroes of 10 different Kamen Rider TV series, from Kuuga through to Decade.

At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect.

Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.\n\nThe world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack.

As the game progresses, the \"Mad Bomber\" traverses the top of the screen much more erratically, dropping bombs at increasingly higher speeds, making each of the seven higher levels more difficult.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Activision"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":378604800,"platforms":["Atari 2600","Atari 8-bit","Atari 5200"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co97gr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12310,"name":"Kangaroo","summary":"Kangaroo is arcade game that was released in 1982.

When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. \n \nTo do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. \n \nBesides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Design Design"],"publishers":["Streetwise","Bug-Byte Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/huaqfn9q2octnccczrk5.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1974314211","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Kat%20Trap%3A%20Planet%20of%20the%20Cat-Men"}]},{"igdb_id":13102,"name":"Kami","summary":"Kami is deceptively simple: fold out coloured paper to fill the screen in as few moves as possible.\n\nRelaxing and easy to pick up, you'll soon find yourself deep in contemplation to perfect each puzzle.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["State of Play Games","Flyhigh Works"],"publishers":["CIRCLE Entertainment","State of Play Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1381363200,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2sfb.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"710724007","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kami/id710724007?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"726536638","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kami/id726536638?mt=12&uo=4"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"272040","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/272040"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"44351","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-44351/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"417980","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/KAMI"}]},{"igdb_id":13190,"name":"Kaiju Panic","summary":"Kaiju Panic is a hybrid strategy - tower defence - squad control game with a bright and unique art style.

When the diver is directly over a treasure cache, the boat will lower him into it. The amount of points you will receive when you make it back onto the surface of the ocean, which can range from 50-250, will then appear on the screen, and the boat will raise the diver back up to the surface of the ocean. Once again, you can hold the button to pause the diver's ascent, and push the joystick in either direction to fire a harpoon at the sharks. Once you have made it back up to the surface of the ocean, you will have to repeat the entire process for each of the four remaining treasure caches before the game proceeds to the next round.","genres":[],"developers":["K.

Over the course of the story, he meets and bounds with nine eligible bachelorettes from his school, and can eventually chose to romance one of them.\n\nMuch like its predecessors, the gameplay centers around Oriya exploring his school, his local neighborhood, and the city, during which he can enter restaurants, shops, cafés, houses, etc. and potentially encounter the nine dateable girls and learn more about them through having conversations with them. The nature of these conversations usually depends on which location the girl is found at in and tends to feature multiple answers; in most cases these answers will either advance or hinder the progression of the relationship with the girl in question depending on the player's choices, leading to new story events. The game also features an internal clock and calendar, with some events, such as holiday celebrations or birthdays, only happening at certain times or on certain dates.\n\nThese two systems often times interact, with information given through conversations becoming relevant later down the line - most prominently, the girl in question can give a hint to their tastes in gifts, and if the player later gives them their desired item on their birthdays, it will greatly increase their approval of you.\n\nAlso like its predecessors, the game features scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.\n\n[From MobyGames]","genres":["Simulator","Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Elf Co."],"publishers":["Elf Co."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1093564800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9d4d.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":330607,"name":"Karaoke Animal Party: Sing & Dance","summary":"Sing, dance and have fun with 5 adorable animals in magical settings while enjoying the loudest karaoke for kids with 25 songs full of fun and joy!","genres":["Music","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1738540800,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9fco.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"166707938","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Karaoke%20Animal%20Party:%20Sing%20&%20Dance"}]},{"igdb_id":330648,"name":"Karazakushiki","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1740009600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9d6o.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"473962032","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Karazakushiki"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3505120","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3505120"}]},{"igdb_id":330659,"name":"Kanon no Kakin Nikki","summary":"It is a multi-ending simulation game where you strive to become an alchemist.

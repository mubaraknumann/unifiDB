From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different. Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay. However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet... Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise. Like I said, this game is weird!. Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete. There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay. The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud. Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom). The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern. As you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers. These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation. The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game. The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number. It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle. Although the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay. Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke. It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things. Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot. It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype. Although Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise. Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found. Only one prototype of Kyphus is known to exist. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. A picture of the box was shown in a few Apollo advertisements. It appears to show a wizard battling evil clouds in a temple which is fairly close to the gameplay in the current prototype. Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy and Invoke. It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things. Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot. It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it in the current prototype.","genres":["Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Apollo, Inc."],"publishers":["Apollo, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mqx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":85236,"name":"Kyotokei","summary":"The powerful witch Rika has invaded the peaceful realm of Estaria with an army of monsters!","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1313020800,"platforms":["Wii"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wuq7yey1vcs23cila2iv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":317099,"name":"Kyokkou no Marriage","summary":"一In that country, there were fairies.\n\nOn a continent racing towards modernization, the Religious State of Midier stands out as a heretical anomaly.

You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she's arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas.\n\nYou'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop.

It is an updated version of Taito's original Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium. Like its predecessor, it is a straightforward baseball simulation game for the Famicom which was never released outside of Japan. Besides a roster update and a few graphical improvements there is little difference between this and the previous game in the series.

It was published in Japan for the Famicom in 1988. It is the first of the series of baseball games that was informally known as \"Harisuta\", which saw four games published for the Famicom, and two more for the Super Famicom. The starting entry contains 13 teams, 12 of which are modeled after real Japanese teams, while a 13th team (the I team) consists of a team of women players who represent various idols or models who were popular at the time. The game features a single player mode against the computer, a head-to-head mode for two players, or a home run mode where you compete to see who can hit the most home runs. Before the end of 1988, a version of the same game was released with an updated player roster, under the title Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium '88 Senshuu Shin Data.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":583459200,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6eri.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":294902,"name":"Kyber Kraft","summary":"Cyber roguelite RPG with immersive crafting and progression.

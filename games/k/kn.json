The fights rely strongly on blocking ability, which is triggered by pressing the attack button, then pressing the joystick away as the opponent strikes. If successful, the player gains a few seconds of invincibility with which to counter-attack. However, if no one strikes the player's character while holding the block, they will tire and drop their guard, making them vulnerable to attack. Blocking is vital in certain cases, since some bosses will be vulnerable only after their attack has been blocked by the player.\n\nAs in most beat 'em ups, a desperation attack is performed by pressing both the attack and jump buttons simultaneously. This knocks out most enemies on the screen, but the player loses a little bit of health every time he uses it.","genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom","Playtronic"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":691200000,"platforms":["Arcade","Super Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7k33.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"15143","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15143/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"13892","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Knights of the Round"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"UCMdT4-XKv-R7PSFdTEYhzAw","url":"https://gaming.youtube.com/game/UCMdT4-XKv-R7PSFdTEYhzAw"}]},{"igdb_id":7039,"name":"Knights Contract","summary":"Armed with a razor sharp scythe and explosive witchcraft, players will use these tools with spectacular effects in order to return civility to the land.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.\n\nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.\n\nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.\n\nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.\n\nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.\n\nKnockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.\n\nAfter Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":["EA Sports"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1036800000,"platforms":["Nintendo GameCube"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5yoh.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"5067","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Knockout%20Kings%202003"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"5535","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-5535/"}]},{"igdb_id":51161,"name":"Knockout Party","summary":"Become the winner of the Craziest TV show!\n\nTake part in more than 25 mini games located in hilarious TV sets and experience a unique 1 vs 3 multiplayer experience.

Throughout the game, your character is surrounded by a box. As objects approach you, you must dodge and come up with cunning ways to avoid projectiles in short amounts of time. In some rooms, the dimensions of the box will distort, creating more complex layouts and levels simultaneously.\nIf you know the game front to back, it should only take around 40-60 minutes. However, for a new player, it will likely take 4-5 hours. Of course, Adventure mode isn't the only thing to do, nor will a second play-through seem stale immediately. Once adventure mode is completed, it is suggested to complete your collection, and fight the secret/final boss.\nThe game auto-saves upon entering a new area, and the room before a boss.

Now the pressure is on as you try to repair the communications unit so you can call for the transport ship. Fortunately, the facility is equipped with auto-defense turrets, which you’ll have to manage wisely to keep the creatures from breaching the facility. You can also use the tank rover to easily dispatch of the creatures before they can get a chance to get through the walls. \n \nIf you're confident in your defenses you may even find a little time to go snooping around the facility while you're making your repairs and discover something interesting or useful. Depending on what you do during your assignment on Kepler 37-D, there are 9 possible endings that you can earn.

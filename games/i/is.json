It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Silmarils"],"publishers":["Silmarils"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725760000,"platforms":["Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jiz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":14525,"name":"Ishidó: The Way of Stones","summary":"Ishido: The Way of Stones is a puzzle video game released in 1990 by Accolade and developed by Publishing International.

Ultimately, Accolade was ruled in violation on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting future sales by Accolade of Genesis-compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering.

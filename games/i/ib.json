Players can choose to either lead the characters Bond or Dyne and their airplanes through several levels of \"bullet hell\"-style gameplay in an attempt to defeat the sisters.\n\nThe player's weapons arsenal consists of a main gun and bombs. Bombs must be collected in fragments, and once the player has all of them, the Hadou Cannon can be used. Staying behind the cannon will make the player invincible for the duration of the effect. Additionally, enemies drop various \"options,\" up to two of which can be attached to the wings of the plane to further increase fire power.\n\nThe game has a ranking system. If the player does really well, they go up in rank and thus boss battles will be a lot harder. Rank can be strategically decreased either by dying or by collecting roses, which are created from enemy bullets when the player sets off a bomb. Scoring works by collecting gold medals dropped by destroyed enemies. They must be quickly collected to keep up a scoring chain. Once a new medal pops up, and the medals on screen already haven't been collected yet, the chain is broken.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["CAVE Interactive"],"publishers":["AMI","Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1119571200,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gombjmbhznoaibvnsaib.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":50467,"name":"Ib","summary":"Ib is a freeware adventure video game with elements of psychological horror released in 2012 for Microsoft Windows by the Japanese artist kouri, running on RPG Maker 2000.

Once, she went to a restaurant with her parents and said 'Thanks, you too!' to a waiter who told her to enjoy her meal. ...She hasn't had the courage to show her face there since. But fortune is a fickle mistress, and much to the chagrin of her and her classmates, she's found herself in the window seat at the back of the classroom normally set aside for the main character. And when one misunderstanding leads to another, she briefly considers writing an autobiography and titling it 'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' copyright be damned.\n\nKohinata Koharu is the former student council president and resident popular girl, considered mysterious by some and out of reach to all. It was by sheer happenstance she passed by Komori's classroom when she did, inadvertently saving her from the wonton wrath of her peers. But an accident is just fate by another name, and on a whim, she takes a blossoming interest in the other... with no ulterior motives whatsoever. Setting aside the fact that Komori doesn't believe in genuine altruism, she can't figure out why someone at the top of the pecking order would rub shoulders with a lowly ant like her... But for the longest time, she has wanted to change... if only she could. Now that she can, the opportunity is paired with the harrowing realization that rest of her youth depends on Koharu's opinion of her. When she said \"this couldn't possibly get any worse!!\", that wasn't a challenge, you know!!! So it's easier said than done... but that doesn't mean she doesn't want to try! After all, this is the kind of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that someone like her could only dream of!!\n\nWill Komori be able to grow out of her shell, or will her life turn into a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare himself? Can she really get through all the items on her 'how to properly enjoy my youth! ♡' checklist when it's been untouched for over a year?? A thriving social life might be a bit of a stretch, but surely, she can manage to make a few friends, right?\n\n...Right??","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1670457600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co70o8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":30,"store":"itch","uid":"1824892","url":"https://studiochuunibyou.itch.io/i-became-a-proper-member-of-society-and-got-a-girlfriend-before-graduation"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"874308057","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/I%20Became%20a%20Proper%20Member%20and%20Got%20a%20Girlfriend"}]},{"igdb_id":277934,"name":"I Bring The Chaos","summary":"Embark on a relentless bullet heaven in I Bring The Chaos.

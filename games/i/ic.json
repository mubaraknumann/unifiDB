But this is not the end of the story, but the start of a new game. The lonely Hero is locked in the body of the King, imprisoned on a chessboard, only a sharp sword that slays the enemy with one blow will help him pass several games against the opponent's chess pieces, playing by the rules of chess. The fading light of the torches will show the countdown of the move, but the thickening darkness will hide the opponents in the darkness; and only their eerie voices and glowing symbols will tell the King how not to get checkmated again, not to see the inscription «I Checkmate Thee!» and start all over again.\n\nOn the black and white squares, the King will meet not only animated and beautifully-designed three-dimensional living enemy pieces, but also his own dead ones: pawns, bishops, knights, and the queen. On some of them you can find scrolls, collecting which, you can learn the secret of liberation from the chess trap. You can hide from enemy attacks behind the dead chess pieces, and strike enemy pieces with sword blows, each time creating a new path for the King, where each new move is a step towards death!\n\n«I Checkmate Thee» is an unexpected game combination that combines elements of horror and chess on a chessboard. There are no words in the game, a minimum of text, and everything that is important for passing is shown in the surrounding world.

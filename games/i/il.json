Each choice leads to a unique perspective on this timeless myth, filled with emotional depth, cultural richness, and intense conflict.\n\nAs Taru, you seek to reclaim your honor by vanquishing your old foe, Illuyanka, despite being blinded by rage and driven by the need for revenge. As Inara, you balance loyalty to your father with your own desires, weaving a plan that could either save your people or tear your heart apart. And as Illuyanka, you stand as the embodiment of raw, untamed nature, struggling to maintain your hold against the gods.\n\nExplore Hittite traditions, navigate divine politics, and experience the weight of decisions that shape both the human and divine realms. Will you restore balance to the land, or will chaos reign? The fate of Hatti is in your hands.\n\nYour choices shall shape the tale, yet you may always return or begin anew, perchance adopting another guise. Enjoy your journey, for the very act of recounting these ancient stories binds you to the age-old tradition of the bards and priests who first gave them voice.","genres":["Adventure","Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Now In Time"],"publishers":["Now In Time"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Web browser","Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9skk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146364,"name":"I'll Take You to Tomato Town","summary":"A small game about completing your grocery list.","genres":["Simulator","Indie"],"developers":["Adam Gryu"],"publishers":["Adam Gryu"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1512432000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yq0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":335745,"name":"Illusion Spectre","summary":null,"genres":["Platform","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9jhm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":242067,"name":"Illusion of Itehari","summary":"Fantasy otome game for the Nintendo Switch.","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["LicoBiTs"],"publishers":["LicoBiTs","Aksys Games","Broccoli","TIS","Game Source Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1712793600,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co69t4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":287928,"name":"I'll be Brave, Tomorrow","summary":"A first-person narrative adventure game, telling the story of a sick child playing a 2D platformer.

The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided.\n\nCombat is turn-based, utilizing an \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques.\n\nThe game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Micro Cabin"],"publishers":["Micro Cabin","Brother Industries"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":665366400,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","Sharp X68000","PC (Microsoft Windows)","FM Towns","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9dlc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":118989,"name":"Il Sole e la Luna","summary":"Adventure Fantasy RPG Il Sole e la Luna!

Bodenplatte was the German code word for the bold operation to launch a surprise low-level attack on multiple Allied airfields on Jan 1st, 1945. It contains eight aircraft (additional Collector Planes are available as separate DLCs).\n\nBattle of Bodenplatte puts you at the scene of some of the most important battles on the Western Front as the Allies are knocking on Germany’s door and trying to cross the Rhine River into Germany for the first time. Fly in support of Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and Operation Bodenplatte. Try to once and for all destroy the Luftwaffe or try to blunt the Allied advance into Germany. It’s was the peak piston-engine power and the dawn of the jet age, a time when famous Allied aces roamed the sky and desperate German defenders were trying to just survive, now outnumbered and no longer the masters of the air. Fight in aerial engagements over lush, green farmland and dense wooded forests or find yourself twisting and turning over frozen fields and icy rivers of the bitterly cold winter of 1944-45. Do you have the skills to survive the harrowing air combat?\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Bodenplatte adds a new Western front theater to the IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series of products. Steam requires you own Battle of Stalingrad before you can add Battle of Bodenplatte. Combined with Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Moscow and Battle of Kuban, the series covers the combat pilot experience spanning both Eastern and Western fronts in WWII. Dogfight over the frozen steppes of Russia, the scenic mountains and beaches the Caucasus region or the doorstep of Germany itself. There is not a more monumental combat flight-simulator experience on the market with such a wide range of planes and theaters crafted to this level of detail. The physics, realism, systems, beauty, atmosphere, features, gameplay, performance, history and options combine to set a new standard of playability and fun in this important genre.

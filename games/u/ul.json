As an update, the game utilizes largely identical gameplay mechanics to the original. However, both the aerial combat and X-Factor systems, introduced in Fate of Two Worlds, have received adjustments. In addition to gameplay modifications and new playable characters, the game features several aesthetic changes.\n\nAfter the events of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disrupted the development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional content was created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Capcom","Eighting"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":76.70588235294117,"release_date":1321315200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation Vita","Xbox 360","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yej.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"227750","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/227750"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B005C7R950","url":null},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B005UDTT7C","url":null},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"357190","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/357190"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B06XJGG5LQ","url":null},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"BV701FMDP6SX","url":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ultimate-marvel-vs.-capcom-3/BV701FMDP6SX"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"35938","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-35938/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1336067913","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ultimate%20Marvel%20vs.%20Capcom%203"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"UCUxMi7KXN6Iq5IJniLGtZ-A","url":"https://gaming.youtube.com/game/UCUxMi7KXN6Iq5IJniLGtZ-A"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B06WRSY2JX","url":null},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B005C7R8I8","url":null}]},{"igdb_id":2520,"name":"Ultima VIII: Pagan","summary":"The Ultima VIII Pagan starts exactly where Ultima VII ended.

Under his horrible rule, the people's lives were devastated. A valiant warrior was called forth from another world by Lord British. This warrior overthrew Mondain.\n\nBritania survived the first crisis. But peace in the Kingdom of Britannia did not last long. Minax, the Witch, a disciple of Mondain, became very powerful and ruled the world of darkness. Minax had power to sway the time axis of the universe. However, a legendary hero again came to the rescue, overthrew Minax, and brought peace back to the kingdom.\n\nNow, the Kingdom is about to face its third crisis.

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.\n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.\n\nCharacter creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.\n\nThese unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.\n\nUltima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.\n\nThe FM Towns version, while identical to the others in gameplay, introduces upgraded graphics similar to those used in next installment of the series.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Origin Systems"],"publishers":["Origin Systems","Fujitsu Interactive","MicroProse Software, Inc.","U.S. Gold","Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Pony Canyon","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":499651200,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit","PC-9800 Series","Sharp X68000","PC-8800 Series","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Sharp X1","Atari ST/STE","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac","DOS","FM Towns","Amiga","Apple II","FM-7","Sega Master System/Mark III","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cqa.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":3126,"name":"Ultima Online","summary":"Ultima Online is the product of Richard Garriott's idea for a fantasy game involving several thousand people who can all play in a shared fantasy world.

Some have written that at last it is possible to interpret the tales of the Avatar as they should be, with the proper historical perspective. Some argue that as time moves on, the truth of what actually occurred will fade even further away and that we have a responsibility to preserve the legends as we now know them. However, most agree when it comes to a number of basic theories.\n\nWhile there are those who maintain that the stories of the Avatar are only myths, practically all credible scholars say that at least some elements of the Avatar’s tales are historical fact. In reality, one need look no further than the Isle of the Avatar to see very persuasive evidence that the Avatar did indeed exist - at least as a person if not as a spiritual being!\nIt is most likely that there has been more than one Avatar. All of the writings insist that the Avatar who negotiated the peace between Britannia and the gargoyles is the one and same person who first appeared to vanquish the sorcerer Mondain those many years ago. While saying it is most unlikely, historians do not firmly deny the possibility of there having been only on Avatar. After all, our good sovereign monarch, wise Lord British, has himself displayed an amazing longevity!\n\nWhatever interpretation of history proves to be most accurate, it seems undeniable that the Avatar will not return to our fair kingdom. By all indications the age of magic is coming to an end. With the decline on reliability of mages, and with the kingdom turning away from the magical arts, it is doubtful that extreme danger - that which would require an Avatar’s aid to defeat it - will ever return to Britannia. And thankfully so.\n\nUpon us is the age of The Fellowship, in which one does not simply wait in anticipation for a heroic savior when a crisis occurs.

Among other things, their construction set included the ability to create \"treasure matrices\" that allowed the user to create special effects similar to the ones seen in the main levels. The original set had remnants in its code alluding to features that had been disabled, likely due to their instability or lack of documentation.\n\nPP&S took the code from Craig and Aaron, and released it commercially in a package called the Wizard Expansion Set. This add-on pack also included 50 new levels from a competition held by the company specifically for the expansion; none of the new levels had any advanced features because of the limitations of the original construction set.\n\nElectronic Arts, including Paul Reiche III, used the Construction set created by Aaron and Craig to create a new set of levels. The Construction Set was also included by EA, as were a combination of levels from the original game and from the expansion pack, albeit in a different order from the original PP&S releases.

Bobsled puts players in the ice-riding vehicle, where they must keep the sled on the optimal groove of the course to get the fastest time and Curling is like ice bowling or shuffleboard. Features 10 courses for each event and link-up play for two.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Sproing Interactive Media"],"publishers":["Telegames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1075593600,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9vxs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":49208,"name":"Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy - The Path of the Superhero","summary":"BUMBLING BICEPS, the world of wrestling will never be the same!\n\n...because now there's a new Kid in town - Kid Muscle!

The game was a massive hit in Europe (except in Germany, where it was worse received due to some similarities with managers produced by local software houses such as Software 2000 and Ascaron), although it gained little support in Japan. \n \nThe series was noted for its micromanagement, where the player had to do the job of the team manager and much of that of the chairman, from player training up to bank balance management. Other well-known features were to bung an opposing team for preferential market treatment, rig or betting on the outcome of the players' team matches. Interviews after the match where some answers were printed with different interpretations on the next days' newspaper (the player could reply a question about the game with \"It was a game of two halves\", and \"He amazed us after the game by giving us an insight into the rules of football\" would be printed on the newspapers). \n \nIn all three games, the game always kept the same visual style: the main screen is a bird's eye view of the stadium facility (where clicking on the grass brings the squad selection screen or in the stands for the stadium builder) and all screens are presented like the player was inside an office (TCM 2004 used a similar interface option). To increase the feeling of \"being there\", tables are accessed via teletext, news from a newspaper and fixtures are available by clicking on a sheet attached to a clipboard. \n \nWhile improving with each game, most features were the same from the start of the series. The game compared favourably in all areas but AI against its leading competitor, Championship Manager. While similar in name, it has no relations with Ultimate Soccer. \n \nThe second version of the game, USM 2 ran in protected mode, featured a more polished interface (plus teams and players of the 1996-1997 season and also the French and German leagues (although in the last the final name of the players had a letter swapped to avoid legal problems regarding licensing) which could be accessed with different executables. In Germany, a localized version of the game was released under the name \"DSF Fussball Manager\", DSF being a well-known German TV sports channel.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":851990400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mdpacrxw0lymfqktctf4.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6541","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-6541/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"5985","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ultimate%20Soccer%20Manager%202"}]},{"igdb_id":56722,"name":"Ultimate Action Triple Pack","summary":"Three of Square Enix's most popular action titles on a single disc.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1414713600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fthpy3jyapihowl2etnr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":56723,"name":"Ultimate Stealth Triple Pack","summary":"Three \"stealth\" themed games from Square Enix, on a single disc.","genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1414713600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jmf0cv9q6suj3tifrovp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":57133,"name":"Ultron","summary":"A Space Invaders clone in which the player controls the most powerful craft in the universe, the Ultron, at the bottom of the screen moving left or right and tries to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Icon Software"],"publishers":["Icon Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["BBC Microcomputer System","Acorn Electron"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p1ckcrcd64shtmzgzri6.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"57513","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-57513/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"494866","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ultron"}]},{"igdb_id":57203,"name":"Ultimate Dunker","summary":"Ultimate Dunker is a single player sports game for IOS & Android that highlights dunking the ball and offers the ultimate gaming experience.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ahfsjzmj9kp9mdfokusm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":57299,"name":"Ultima Online: Time of Legends","summary":"The Time of Legends expansion pack was released in October 2015.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bi4sipue6owktylti5ml.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":57969,"name":"Ultra Rainbow Bake Sale","summary":"A singleplayer, deck-building, baking game.","genres":["Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lmh5cnyefkpw0nz7ol6k.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":59362,"name":"Ultraman All-Star Chronicle","summary":"A Japan only PlayStation Portable strategy game developed by Bandai Namco Games as part of their long running Ultraman series","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Bandai Namco Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1362614400,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7yu4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":59472,"name":"Ultra Hat Dimension","summary":"Ultra Hat Dimension is a violent puzzle game about adorable hats and people getting punched for wearing them.

decades of scientific and social enlightenment, nations had to deal with increasing overpopulation, terrorism. pollution and a collapsing economic system. This led to increased border tensions, and soon small regional wars turned into a Global War, where all kinds of weapons were used, killing millions and destroying vast amounts of knowledge. As the use of nuclear weapons rendered many oil fields useless due to radiation, mankind had to turn away from fossil fuels, and eventually outlawed their use and turn to clean energy sources. \n \nDuring the war, China had broken up into several independent states, but thanks to their reliance in both old and new technologies, they bounced back, and under the hand of Emperor Zindo reunited, and went to control most of Asia. The United States, while had their population devastated, managed to hold their infrastructures and technology mostly intact, and had Mexico and Canada joining as new states, as well as a change in the constitution that changed the government into a private company, with certain special citizens being considered \"shareholders\". \n \nDue to the limitations of non-fossil energy sources, the control of a recently discovered material (Thermodux) that could amplify the power output of those energy sources is highly coveted. So, after an accident that killed the researchers and completing an hostile take-over of India Incorporated, Zendo announced a \"security attachment\" to \"protect\" the Solomon Islands (where Thermodux was being studied) from further terrorist threat. However, The US contracted a mercenary company, Navco, to clear the island, with the player joining as new recruit for the company, working for cash and shares in the US government. \n \nThe game is a typical flight combat simulator, with missions involving patrol, defense and attacking enemy facilities. The ultimate goal of the game is to survive each mission, taking down as many enemy aircraft as possible to collect a bounty, that can be used to purchase better weaponry and new crafts.

Titans - now worshiped as gods - are cruel and uncaring. They bestow power on their most dedicated followers who, in turn, terrorize Pagan's population. To find a way back home, you need to become a Titan yourself before the Guardian succeeds in his plot to conquer Britannia--and then Earth itself.\n\nThe eighth installment of the Ultima series takes a much darker tone.

Without a party to assist you, you must rely on your own strength, dexterity, intelligence, and magical abilities to save Britannia and Earth.\nDark, engrossing story with a moral dilemma: will you accept evil for the sake of the greater good?\nMuch more action-oriented than previous installments with fluent and responsive combat mechanics and new ways to explore the unknown.\nLiving world: each inhabitant has his or her own schedule, going about ordinary business in Pagan.\nIncludes the speech pack: some of the major game characters are fully voiced.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Origin Systems"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":851990400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coapcw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":102478,"name":"Ultimate Farm Simulator","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":103586,"name":"Ultra Sharp","summary":"Cut with skill to complete the 320 ingenious handmade levels of Ultra Sharp and become a cut master!\n\nYour finger has never been so sharp!","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["1Button"],"publishers":["Lion Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1528934400,"platforms":["iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co57i8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":103629,"name":"Ultimate Custom Night","summary":"Welcome to the ultimate FNAF mashup, where you will once again be trapped alone in an office fending off killer animatronics!

Sprites, backgrounds and UI elements have been redrawn using later entries in the series as a reference.\n\nThe interface has been improved within the limitation of the game engine, introducing Quality-Of-Life changes that reduce some of the frustration with the original release. Most notably, cancelling an action during combat (e.g. pressing B at magic spell selection, or selecting Magic on a character that is not capable of casting spells) will not forfeit that character’s turn. It is still possible to pass a turn by pressing B before selecting any action.\n\nMany aspect of the gameplay have been slightly altered to make grinding at lower levels unnecessary, and level progression more rewarding. Defeating monsters found in more dangerous locations such as dungeons is also more rewarding as it provides better loot and more XP.\n\nThe combat AI has also been improved, and changes have been introduced to better differentiate the 11 professions and 5 races, including “special abilities” such as critical hits for high level Thieves and extra melee damage for Barbarians.\n\nAlmost all the enemies that were present in the computer versions of the game have been added, including Chests (only in Castle Death), Wizards and the Orcus.\n\nNumerous typos and inconsistencies in the game’s text/dialogues have also been fixed, and many dialogue lines that were present but not accessible in the original release have been re-instated. This includes one important clue that had been infamously “removed” (but was actually present in ROM, just not referenced).","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Fox Cunning"],"publishers":["Fox Cunning"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1609200000,"platforms":["Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co55el.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":215401,"name":"Ultimate Flying Cars","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co55yi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":215679,"name":"Ultimate Protector","summary":"Tired of moving around without purposes?

It was tested only in the Chicago and San Francisco areas that used a dedicated T1 line, connected directly to Midway's Chicago headquarters. It is highly unlikely that any Wave Net test games were ever released to the public after the infrastructure was dismantled, and so there are no known ROM image dumps of this version. One of the reasons this version was not widely adopted was the cost of T1 lines at the time: the setup cost several thousand dollars per arcade installation, plus a few hundred dollars for each cabinet using the hardware. Williams' plan was to use WaveNet to upload new games and game updates, which they would provide to arcade owners for free in exchange for a cut of the games' revenues.\n\nThe Wave Net version ultimately received its first full release as part of the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Collection compilation in 2025.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Midway"],"publishers":["Midway"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coacqs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":364017,"name":"Ultimate Pain","summary":"Ultimate Pain (UP) is wild, sock-blasting journey of non-stop jumping madness!

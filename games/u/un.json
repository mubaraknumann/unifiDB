Smaller mining companies have been running smaller matches to channel aggression, but now the Liandri Mining Corporation established a professional league, which quickly proves to be an extremely lucrative way of public entertainment. Liandri entered into the Tournament, as it is officially called, sponsoring their own team, the Corrupt. The Corrupt's leader, Xan Kriegor, quickly achieved champion status and held it for two years. In 2293, a human named Malcolm dethroned him and became champion himself. A huge media figure, Malcolm is hailed as the biggest star in human history and is worshipped as a god. His success nets great rewards for his sponsoring corporation, attracting the attention of jealous rivals both in the arenas of the Tournament and in the corridors of power a galaxy away. Liandri attempted to win back the champion title with Xan MK2 but failed (unknown to the other contestants, each member of the Corrupt is purely robotic, including Xan).\nNow it is 2302. The Tournament is undergoing a massive overhaul. The aging Sniper Rifle (a relic of centuries past) is removed from the Tournament as is \"Assault\" - a team-based event that forms a part of the competition. Many fans of the Tournament complain at these changes, with some combatants refusing to participate in the new format. Malcolm, shortly after his victory, hired two of his former opponents (Brock and Lauren, members of the former Iron Guard team) as teammates in his reformed Thunder Crash team. But the Axon Research Corporation, another of the four great corporations, entered the Tournament as well, sponsoring the geneboosted Juggernaut team, led by the brutal and savage Gorge.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Epic Games","Digital Extremes"],"publishers":["Infogrames","MacSoft Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1033430400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2acz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":927,"name":"Unreal Tournament 2004","summary":"Unreal Tournament 2004 is a multiplayer first person shooter that combines the kill-or-be-killed experience of gladiatorial combat with cutting-edge technology. Ten game modes - both team-based and \"every man for himself\" -- provide even the most hardcore gamer with palm-sweating challenges through unbelievably detailed indoor arenas and vast outdoor environments. As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future, players will take their fates into their hands, battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed, frag-filled arenas.\n\nAssault Mode - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004, this fan-favorite mode sees teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases, from fast-moving trains, barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship, poised to attack the human home world.\n\nOnslaught Mode - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level! Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core. Taking place in massive outdoor environments, here is where vehicular combat comes into its own. Flying and driving machines take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks.\n\nVehicles - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land-, air-, and space-based vehicles that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught. With vehicles ranging from single man fighters to five man behemoths, Unreal Tournament 2004 provides players with plenty of choices when shopping for a mechanized implement of destruction.\n\nLevels - More than 95 maps will be available immediately, including more than 45 brand new maps for all existing game play modes as well as new modes of play. Vast outdoor environments, deep space combat areas and tightly packed indoor techno-arenas are all waiting for the latest entrants to the Tournament.\n\nWeapons - The entire smorgasbord of frag-dealing weaponry from Unreal Tournament 2003 returns for the experienced player to wield masterfully against new contestants. Those armaments are joined by three new implements of doom: the Mine layer, which disperses spider-like bombs that chase and harass any enemy that comes within range; the anti vehicle rocket launcher, or AVRiL, which deals out a payload of massive rockets tuned to seek and destroy enemy mechanized units; the Grenade Launcher, which launches timed explosives that will bounce on the ground and stick to enemies and enemy vehicles, only to be triggered by the weapons altfire command; and, the return of the notorious Sniper Rifle from the original Unreal tournament, completely redesigned and upgraded to make heads roll.\n\nNew Characters - Unreal Tournament 2004 introduces 32 new characters on four new teams: The human Thunder Crash, lead by Tournament hero, Malcolm; the Robotic Corrupt, lead by an upgraded Xan Kriegor; the Iron Skull, a team of merciless Skaarj warriors; and the Hellions -- wreckless human mercenaries and pirates who delight in the thrill of the kill.\n\nNew Technology - Unreal Tournament not only brings new content for hardcore fans to relish, it also delivers a tremendous technology update over its predecessor, delivering a faster, slicker, deeper experience than ever before.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Epic Games"],"publishers":["MacSoft Games","Epic Games","Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":88.0,"release_date":1079395200,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cpw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":928,"name":"Unreal Tournament III","summary":"Unreal Tournament 3 marks the return of the world's premiere first-person shooter to Xbox 360.

Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \"Butterfly Effect\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \"hundreds of endings\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.\n\nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Supermassive Games"],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":79.5,"release_date":1440460800,"platforms":["PlayStation 4"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2s5q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":7878,"name":"Unturned","summary":"Fast! you must find some resources to survive! explore the towns, kill some zombies, \"steal\" cars, food, weapons and gear, collect wood, make your own base, build your farm and keep an eye open!

Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Square Product Development Division 2"],"publishers":["Atari Europe","Square Enix","Square"],"aggregated_rating":43.0,"release_date":1040256000,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5uw4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11812,"name":"Universe Sandbox Legacy","summary":"Create and destroy on a scale you’ve never imagined!","genres":["Simulator","Sport","Indie"],"developers":["Giant Army"],"publishers":["Giant Army"],"aggregated_rating":84.0,"release_date":1304035200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1lxz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11813,"name":"Universe Sandbox","summary":"Create and destroy on an unimaginable scale... with a space simulator that merges real-time gravity, climate, collision, and material interactions to reveal the beauty of our universe and the fragility of our planet.

Players compete in a series of matches of various types, with the general aim of out-killing opponents. The PC version supports multiplayer online or over a local area network. Free expansion packs were released, some of which were bundled with a 2000 re-release: Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition.\n\nThe game is based on the same technology that powered Unreal, but the design of Unreal Tournament shifted the series' focus to competitive multiplayer action. Development took 18 months, and the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal. Unreal Tournament received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the graphics, artificial intelligence and gameplay, although the console ports were noted for having limitations. The game won several awards, and remakes have been attempted by fans. The series has continued with the releases of sequels Unreal Tournament 2003 in 2002, Unreal Tournament 2004 in 2004, and Unreal Tournament 3 in 2007.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Epic Games"],"publishers":["Epic Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":972432000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co635k.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":24977,"name":"Until I Have You","summary":"Until I Have You is a 2D side-scrolling action platform video game which has 12 chapters with 4 stages and a unique boss each, taking place within a different setting. The goal for each stage is to get to the end of the stage as fast as possible without falling, getting killed or depleting your sanity gauge.\n\nCentral to Until I Have You is the exoskeleton suit. The suit gives the player special abilities at the cost of the player's sanity. The exoskeleton comes with the abilities to slow down time, ala Max Payne and to rewind time. However, overuse of these abilities will cause the sanity bar to deplete making your character lose touch with reality. When the sanity bar depletes your character starts to hallucinate, altering gameplay mechanics and level design.\n\nIn each stage, the player navigates his way from left to right through platforming sections, death traps, and enemies. The goal is to do this as fast as possible with the least amount of deaths. The fast pace of the game can make it difficult to plan a perfect approach. To make up for this, the game allows the player to restart each stage the moment they die, allowing them to quickly fine-tune their approach over several attempts. At the end of each chapter the player must also defeat a unique boss. Along the way the player acquires a number of weapons and upgrades that you can cycle through, all of which have a specific use.\n\nThe game grades the player's performance at the end of each stage based on a number of factors and given a percentage raring out of 100. Things you get judged on include method of death, whether you kill any of the enemies and what you killed them with.","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["Wormwood Studios"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1459728000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co223s.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"53301","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-53301/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"439310","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/439310"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"492128","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Until%20I%20Have%20You"}]},{"igdb_id":25035,"name":"Under Southern Skies","summary":"Simulates the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939.","genres":["Simulator","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["Microcomputer Games, Inc."],"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Company"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":457488000,"platforms":["Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sauaf4vzguyl85prbuwx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1905715648","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Under%20Southern%20Skies"}]},{"igdb_id":25314,"name":"Unworthy","summary":"\"Death, the great equalizer.\"\nUnworthy is a hardcore combat-focused metroidvania without jumping.\n\nPrepare to die...\n\nA lot.","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Aleksandar Kuzmanovic Games"],"publishers":["Aleksandar Kuzmanovic Games","Peak Games"],"aggregated_rating":75.0,"release_date":1527552000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co222x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":25672,"name":"Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi","summary":"Escape from “Yomi” – a dungeon filled with riches – and danger.\n\nYou have been recruited into the Undernauts – a team of brave subterranean adventurers who comb the depths of a massive, monster-infested labyrinth in search of priceless resources.\n\nMake use of your powerful skills and magic items to create exits and reach the surface alive.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Experience Inc."],"publishers":["Experience Inc.","Aksys Games"],"aggregated_rating":88.0,"release_date":1591920000,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3daf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":25715,"name":"Unearned Bounty","summary":"Unearned Bounty is a single or multiplayer pirate ship arena combat game where you strive to become the most infamous pirate of the high seas.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\n\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\n\nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.\n\nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\n\nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\n\nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\n\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Koei"],"publishers":["Koei","Koei Tecmo Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":729302400,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","Sharp X68000","Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","DOS","FM Towns"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ba8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"628170","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/628170"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"5091","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-5091/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"4659","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Uncharted Waters 2: New Horizons"}]},{"igdb_id":38415,"name":"Universal Soldier","summary":"Universal Soldier is a cancelled video game based on the 1992 movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Battles are team oriented, which allows building complex strategies to defeat strong ennemies.\n\nAn accent has been put on the world's richness. Never explore an empty world again: Mystria is filled with resources to harvest, random encounters to make, and secrets that are waiting to be discovered. Every time you explore a map, random elements will either spawn or not, which may open unknown paths. There is no level scaling in the game, and each of the 300 maps can be explored right from the beginning. Explore the world at your own risks!\n\nDuring fights, while one's soul can hold up to 10 Achivaras, but only 3 can be summoned at a time; strategies should be prepared thoroughly in order to win against strong opponents. Actions, which can be either of a sin or a virtue type, have different properties and can combo with other actions. If you don't have any Achivara alive anymore, the fight isn't over! In Unleashed, you have to fight yourself for your survival.\n\nFeedback from indie development forums:\n\"I am glad I took the time to click, because it looks great!\" - Typogre\n\"Certainly sounds like an interesting concept!\" - bfarnsey\n\"I love the art style.\" - ThylacineStudios\n\"This is potentially really cool-looking.

The can falls into the pit and bounces along the pile of waste until it comes to rest. Simple, right?

For example, a container of Type 1 waste may be dropped onto another Type 1 container as long as it bounces to a different location and does not come to rest in contact with Type 1 waste. \n \nAlso, you can only hold a can for a short time (depending on which speed you selected). When you are handed a can, a timer in the upper right-hand corner of the screen counts down. When it reaches zero, a buzzer sounds and you must drop the waste in your tracks. Needless to say, this could be disastrous. \n \nYou get 10 points for every container successfully dumped.

Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above.\nOne day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there's only one place they could have gone: the Devil's Tower.\n\nA search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact.\n\nThis is their story. Or at least, it's how each of them remembers it.\n\nExpanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon.\n\nCome see how long you can last in the Devil's Tower...","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Nihon Falcom"],"publishers":["XSEED Games","Nihon Falcom","DotEmu"],"aggregated_rating":80.2,"release_date":1166659200,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation Vita","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2z70.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B08FS2WPPW","url":null},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B08FS2WPPW","url":"https://amazon.de/dp/B08FS2WPPW"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1422357892","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/ys_origin"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"17885","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-17885/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"207350","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/207350"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"225456","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/225456"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B08FS4SGBK","url":null},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"16400","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ys%20ORIGIN"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B08FS1YTKW","url":"https://amazon.co.uk/dp/B08FS1YTKW"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"BNSRQV4C66X9","url":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ys-origin/BNSRQV4C66X9"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B08FS2WPPW","url":"https://amazon.de/dp/B08FS2WPPW"}]},{"igdb_id":15449,"name":"Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter","summary":"A bright light shot up from Darm Tower in the end of the first Ys, and Adol Christin is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground.

But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop an evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is.\n\nYs II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter is a direct sequel to Ys: The Vanished Omens. The game continues to utilize the action role-playing combat style of the first installment, which requires the player to make the protagonist run into the enemy in order to cause damage, without the need to press an attack button. The player should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise the hero will be killed. The player character can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade weapons and inventory, like in most other RPGs.\n\nThe sequel offers a longer quest than the first installment, and adds a magic arsenal to Adol's abilities. Among the magic spells is a fire attack, a time-stopping spell, and a transformation ability that allows Adol to pass for a monster and converse with enemies. Magic spells deplete Adol's magic points bar.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Nihon Falcom"],"publishers":["Nihon Falcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":577670400,"platforms":["PC-8800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4wya.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":15450,"name":"Ys: Wanderers from Ys","summary":"Adol Christin's long-time friend, Dogi, wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.

Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding.

An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself.

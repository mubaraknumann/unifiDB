As in other match-three games, the player is presented with a grid of tiles (here called tokens) that can be removed by making matches of three or more tiles of the same colour. What makes this variant of the concept different is that the objective isn't just to remove the tokens but to move Spider-Man across the grid to a special destination. Each level has a path that Spider-Man follows. The path is hidden and is only revealed by swapping and removing tokens that are over the path. Spider-Man moves automatically when the path is revealed. Each level is time-based and Spider-Man has to reach his destination before the timer runs out.\n\nThe game features some special power-up tokens that will help the player. For example, there are the scramble tokens that shuffle all tokens on the grid, the spider-sense tokens that reveal the path temporarily, and the rage tokens that can be used to plough through tokens blocking the path. Spider-Man will be chased by black goo on some levels and has to finish the levels before being caught.","genres":["Puzzle","Arcade"],"developers":["Sony Pictures Mobile"],"publishers":["Sony Pictures Mobile"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1183248000,"platforms":["Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5r06.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38573,"name":"Space Attack","summary":"Space Attack is an arcade shooting game, released by Sega for VIC Dual hardware in 1979.

After his resurrection by the Terror Mask, Rick makes his way through the mansion, fighting off hordes of creatures in a vain attempt to save his girlfriend Jennifer from a grisly fate. Players of this game will also recognize a number of western horror film influences, such as Friday the 13th and Evil Dead 2.\n\nSimilar to many sidescrolling beat 'em up games, Rick can only move in a two-dimensional environment. The playing field does not feature a three-dimensional area, a feature that was added later in the series with Splatterhouse 3. He has the ability to jump and can punch and kick. Rick also has a Special Attack, where he will perform a drop kick that sends him skidding along the ground, damaging any enemies he hits. Rick can also perform a low kick, low punch, and jumping attacks, as well as pick up and use various weapons placed in the levels.\n\nAll of the levels consist of walking left to right, with occasional auto-scrolling segments. However, alternative pathways through sections of the house are possible by falling down through holes or jumping up onto ladders. In this way, branching gameplay is possible, if only prevalent in the middle levels. Levels culminate in boss fights that take place in a single room. Unlike traditional side-scrolling fighters, boss fights have varying objectives and styles. Unlike most arcade games in the genre, Splatterhouse sends players back to checkpoints after losing lives or reaching game over, discouraging \"credit feeding\" as a method of overcoming the various challenges.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco","Ving Co., Ltd.","Namco Bandai Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":594345600,"platforms":["Arcade","Wii","PC (Microsoft Windows)","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","FM Towns"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2sun.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":369125,"name":"Spray N' Pray","summary":"Spray N' Pray is a fast-paced boomer shooter where you play as Justinian, a priest armed with dual revolvers.

The pieces can then be pushed horizontally or vertically with the goal being to recreate a picture which can be shown at any time by pressing a button. The game is timed and if a puzzle is not completed fast enough, one of three lives will be lost.\n\nAll features from the original game are retained. This include doors that open and close and that can be used to push pieces out of play. They will then be put pack into the queue and be ready to be launched again. There are also various bonus items that can be pushed into each other for bonus points or time increases. Some items have negative effects such as bombs that explode after five seconds (and take a life away). Bombs have to be pushed out through a door or combined with a water tap to be destroyed. At some places there are cracks in the walls. Pushing a piece into a crack causes it to bounce back to its original position.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Imagineer"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9i9z.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":387564,"name":"Sparkle & Umbra","summary":"Light and gravity collide, and the truth cracks everything open.","genres":["Music","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1769385600,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cobdp1.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":368782,"name":"Spy Guy Memory: Circus","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1758844800,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaknh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":345641,"name":"Spikeventure","summary":"SPIKEVENTURE is a SMBX2 episode where you play as a Spike!

You can quit the game at any time and continue exactly where you left off later.

Use the arrow buttons or swipe on the screen to move to the left, the right, the top or the bottom. All planets will then move into that direction as far as they can. Planets of the same kind will merge into a new planet with their combined value and your score is updated. You win once you have one planet with the value of 2048. And that is much easier said then done.\n\nVisuals are a big part of the gaming experience and to match the overall theme all interface elements like the triple setting sound switch for example (full sound with background music, effects only or sound off) rotate floating in space.

Each new game in the series adds another page to the history giving it a depth and complexity almost unrivalled within the RPG genre. In Spectral Force Genesis, the player will be able to take command of a country and using a mix of strategy, diplomacy and force, attempt to bring the whole kingdom under unified rule. You will meet a lot of different characters along the way and as events gradually unfold the player will make decisions which will trigger a whole host of surprising events and scenarios.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Ignition Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":55.0,"release_date":1271376000,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8kzi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":144611,"name":"Spread Eagle Cross the Block!","summary":"Play as MC Ride from the band Death Grips as you literally spread eagles across a city block.

Think of it like a cross between Company of Heroes and Supreme Commander, as designed by someone who played neither. \n \nOriginally begun in 2002 as a single-unit modification for Total Annihilation called Axis & Allies TA, the game has since grown well beyond its original plans. The mod was completed in August of 2005, with the main dev at that point (M_26_7 / SpikedHelmet) deciding it was time to move on. Not long after, an early version of the Spring engine was released — an engine designed to run content from Total Annihilation, and Axis & Allies TA was soon ported by a fan, and then by FLOZi in November of 2005. The port was then released in December 2006 with a few bits of new content (mostly infantry models) and updated game play elements. \n \nAfter that release, AATA was reborn as Spring: 1944 – a complete re-build from scratch, using all-new content and a new design philosophy. While our release schedule has been a tad on the erratic side, work has been progressing continuously ever since 2006, with published builds going out approximately once or twice a year. The game reached a nearly completed state between 2010-2011, and most of the work since that point has focused on balance, a handful of new gameplay mechanics, cleaning up the game’s internals and smoothing out the experience for new players.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1167523200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":383359,"name":"Spirit-Capture Net","summary":"In \"Spirit-Capture Net,\" guide a small spirit through a world of light and obstacles.

The player can crawl walls and web swing, though Spider-Man is only able to move forward in a straight line. They can also lock their camera onto certain enemies and web them.\n\nAs Spider-Man, players must master new combo moves as they protect the city of Manhattan from the nefarious Doc Ock and other classic Marvel villains by swinging, jumping and wall-crawling through 19 new levels that extend beyond the film. Featuring an unprecedented depth of gameplay, players experience original storylines and battle through graphically rich 3D environments. Swing, climb and web-sling through interactive 3D environments while experiencing scenarios, settings and characters based on the hit film and others that are exclusive to the game. In addition to Doc Ock, gamers must battle a plethora of characters in Spider-Man's legendary Rogue's Gallery of villains, such as Mysterio, Rhino, Shocker and Vulture. Utilizing the graphical power of the PSP, Spider-Man 2 delivers amazing console-like 3D graphics and incredibly immersive gameplay never before seen in a handheld Spider-Man game.

Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green.\n\n16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist's arctic ice to the drug cartel's native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":696902400,"platforms":["Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2y5b.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":240029,"name":"Spider Queen Cave","summary":"The student sister who has been secretly in love for a long time has been missing for three months.

The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long. To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward. Once the fireball starts to spin, press the fire button to shoot it. The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field). If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult, then you will be taken to the second level. If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you. Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down. If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life. Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life. You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will lose a life. The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four).","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":441676800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mpv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":233432,"name":"Spiders: Cobweb Shooter","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":233445,"name":"Spear Knight","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":233431,"name":"Space BlocKing","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":238913,"name":"Spring Crisis","summary":"This is a Touhou doujin game by 46flare.","genres":["Platform","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["white flare"],"publishers":["white flare"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1356825600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co66gy.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":41501,"name":"SpectrumTap","summary":"Gems change colors rapidly.

The aim then is to rebuild these parts of each level so that the spider can move on to the next. This is done with the use of coloured tiles. The HUD shows a flashing dot that indicates what colour is needed. The spider then has to find a tile in that colour and move it to the tile that needs to be repaired. Once this is all done the spider gets access to a teleporter and can move on to the next level. The spider isn't alone however. It has to be careful not to come into contact with the balls that move around the web. Balls can be destroyed by building a web in front of them.

In Spasim the players flew around in space and to each other they appeared as wire-frame space ships. Their positions were updated about every second.\n\nThe game was played on the PLATO computer system, and was heavily influenced by another PLATO space multiplayer game Empire. Later 3D multiplayer games on the PLATO network included airace by Silas Warner that evolved into airfight (by Brand Fortner), and then spawned Panther by John Edo Haefeli at NW University. Atari, Inc had a PLATO account and Panther is said to be the origin of Battlezone while airfight led up to Sublogic's Microsoft Flight Simulator.

The game's most important innovation was its introduction of scrolling graphics, where the sprites moved along a vertical scrolling overhead track, with the course width becoming wider or narrower as the player's car moves up the road, while the player races against other rival cars, more of which appear as the score increases. The faster the player's car drives, the more the score increases.\n\nIn contrast to the volume-control dials used for Pong machines at the time, Speed Race featured a realistic racing wheel controller, which included an accelerator, gear shift, speedometer, and tachometer. It could be played in either single-player or alternating two-player, where each player attempts to beat the other's score. The game also featured an early example of difficulty levels, giving players an option between \"Beginner's race\" and \"Advanced player's race\".\n\nSpeed Race would be the first in a long-running series of arcade games based on the same concept during the 1970's and early 1980's. Speed Race itself was re-released twice in 1978 during the cocktail craze in Japanese arcades - first as a tabletop/cocktail variant and then as a tabletop/cocktail color variant.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":152496000,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9r0q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":327553,"name":"Spectrum of the Puddle","summary":"\"Spectrum of the Puddle\" is an exhilarating action game where water and light bounce around.

It is based on Spacewar!, a PDP-1 program. It was ported to the Vectrex in 1982.\nSpace Wars was the brainchild of Larry Rosenthal, an MIT graduate who was fascinated with the original Spacewar! and developed his own custom hardware and software so that he could play the game. Cinematronics worked with Rosenthal to produce the Space Wars system.\nTwo players controlled different ships. One button rotated the ship left, another rotated the ship right, one engaged thrust, one fired a shell, and one entered hyperspace (which causes the ship to disappear and reappear elsewhere on the playfield at random).\nThe game offered a number of gameplay options, including the presence or absence of a star in the middle of the playfield (which exerted a positive or negative gravitational pull), whether the edges of the playfield \"wrapped around\" to their opposite sides, and whether shells bounced. Three other fascinating features were unique to this game. First, the game could not be played in \"one player\" mode; a human opponent was required. Second, the player's ship could take a glancing hit without dying, but would suffer damage; a cloud of loose ship fragments would break off and float away, after which the ship would be visibly damaged on screen and would turn and accelerate more slowly. Third and most memorable was that the duration of play for any contest was solely governed by the amount of money deposited; each quarter bought a minute and a half of play. A dollar bought six minutes, and for a ten dollar roll of quarters two players could play non-stop for an hour.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Cinematronics","Cinematronics"],"publishers":["GCE","Cinematronics","Taito","Sega, S.A.

The spies must gather the three segments of a rocket and then dive into a sea where a submarine awaits them. However, only connected segments can be carried at any one time.

In a desperate search to find a new home, they found Evath, a life-sustaining planet with two moons, Mitral and Tricuspid. They sent a ship, named \"Exodus\" to colonize this new planet with explorers, embryos and supplies. Generations passed, and the colony on Evath was formed. Without the rule of law, the oldest members of the Exodus' crew, the Elders, were forced to take control, form an army and bring the rule of law to Evath.\n\nLesleigh Skerrit aspired to work for the Driller Federation. His grandfather had been a member of the Federation, but he was falsely accused of murder and banished as a Ketar. Only later did the evidence contesting his guilt surface, but it was too late - the law did not allow someone banished as a Ketar to return to Evath. Lesleigh was not bitter and did not seek retribution. He wanted to study law to prevent this kind of mistake happening again.\n\nCalled in by his superior, Montigue Yarbro, he is offered a lifetime opportunity - to complete his training and gain a promotion to Elite within the Driller Federation in one fell swoop. His experience on Mitral bore him well - he was to go to Mitral and attempt to avert the coming catastrophe. Mitral, having been abandoned in its unstable state by the Ketars, was going to explode within four hours, and the explosion would take Evath with it. Skerrit's mission was to use the excavation probe \"Last Hope\" to place eighteen drilling rigs around Mitral to allow the gas to dissipate harmlessly into space and prevent this disaster.

You take control of a robot who must collect Earth's Energy Crystals that were stolen by \"Computer Controlled Androids\". The uniqueness of the game comes from the fact that not only can you walk up and down the corridors on the bottom of the screen, but also on the sides and top of the screen. Therefore, the game has a 3D aspect to it which makes your mission much harder to complete, especially considering that the controls change accordingly with the different sides of the screen (if you are controlling your robot on the bottom part of the screen all that is needed to move forward is a press \"up\" on the joystick. However, once on the top of the screen, a press \"down\" on the joystick moves you forward). This change of joystick movement helps create a more realistic feel that really helps the game out and makes it more fun to play, however frustrating it may be first. After you have the controls for the game down, which can prove to be very tricky, the next step is to go about completing your mission to get back all the of the Earth's Energy Crystals, which are represented by little red diamonds throughout the 3D maze. However, there are a few curve balls thrown in. If you are unable to collect the crystals after 40 seconds, they become radioactive. This means that if you touch a crystal once it's radioactive (they turn white after becoming so) you will lose a life and fall off into space towards a purple alien ship which appears in the center of the screen. On the other hand, if you do collect all 4 crystals from that round, you might think your job is done, but that's not the case. Even after all the crystals are collected you must still blast the white androids which follow you throughout the maze. Only after all of the androids have been killed will you be able to advance forward. \n \nThe robot you control in the game is also equipped with an electronic vapor gun that will shoot a pulsar beam all the way around the screen which can actually come back and hit you if not careful (and the range of your shot increases as the game progresses, so an accurate hit is necessary later on!). When you do manage to hit one of the androids through they do not simply vanish from the screen, but instead leave behind an energy mass which cannot be passed through by your robot. On later levels when there are many androids roaming about the screen a well planned shot is necessary, because you could actually cage yourself in due to the energy masses. However, there is a way out of a jam if you find that all the crystals have turned radioactive (and therefore cannot be collected) or if you find yourself caged in by energy masses. By the press of a button, you can Beam Up to your yellow ship and then be presented with a fresh board and start all over (but then you lose any crystals you might have managed to collect and the game gets a little harder). One other thing to note about the androids is the fact that they can shoot anti-gravity spray at you, so getting out of the way of their line of fire is another challenge faced on your quest to save the earth. One last little nifty feature of the game is the ability to wear a defensive shield which makes you invincible to anything on the screen. However, the shield can only be used for as long as the red bar on the top of the screen indicates (you actually can take off the shield at any point after putting it on to save the energy bar from being depleted). The shield, and all these other little bonuses tossed into the game, can all be accessed by either the press of the button or by voice recognition if the MBX gaming add-on is attached. All one would need to do in order to activate the shield, for example, would be to simply say \"Shield\" into the microphone! \n \nSpace Bandits is a very interesting game, and has a lot of unique features. However, the mainstream gamer might be turned off a little by the easiness of the first few rounds. At first I wrote this game off as being too easy, but after playing it through to the 5th level I found myself being caged in numerous times by the androids who were out to get the crystals I had collected! So when you give this game a try, play into it a little as the challenge can pick up fairly quickly. In addition, as with all MBX cartridges, this game uses voice recognition and synthesis very well. Being able to speak plain English into a microphone to tell your robot what to do is really a great added dimension to the game.

Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two modes: Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online.\n\nThe meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000, enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races: Standard, Trial and Vendetta.\n\nStandard races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one: breaking speed limits at certain points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash flow. Trial races involve wagering: a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options. These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner taking the loser's car.\n\nThe game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks in 12 configurations), adds a \"Heavy Winter\" configuration to the Canada track and adds one new track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable.

Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST).

Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.\n\nYou have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Atari ST/STE"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5zas.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":306475,"name":"Space Harrier","summary":"A port of Space Harrier for the Sharp MZ-700, released via a magazine in Japan.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Legacy Computer"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":295336,"name":"Spirit Realm Saga","summary":"Spirit Realm Saga is an indie game that combines elements of role-playing, Roguelike, strategy, simulation, tower-defense, and puzzle-solving.

You take control of goofy as he competes in two events, the Marathon Dive and the Pogo Pop.\n\nThe Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out. As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around. Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level). Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over. If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life.\n\nIf Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air. Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below. However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough. If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion). If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim). As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically. Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again.\n\nPogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile. This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land. As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.\n\nWhile you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points. The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":427075200,"platforms":["Atari 5200"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zn2gajypfpwjfmzivqsp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":275659,"name":"Spacerat Miner","summary":"SpaceRat Miner project is a fast paced roguelike mining game with exciting gameplay.

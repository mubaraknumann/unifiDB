Lunar Lander was originally written as a text-based computer game in the FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 computer by Jim Storer while a student at Lexington High School (Massachusetts) in the autumn of 1969.\n\nStorer submitted the game to the DEC users' newsletter, which distributed the source code to readers. Other versions of the concept were written soon after: a version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC, among others.\n\nA full game of Rocket, one of the early versions of the game type. The player has only spent fuel at the last moment, and as a result has crashed into the moon.\n\nAll three text-based games require the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Jim Storer"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":-8035200,"platforms":["PDP-8"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gcp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":281022,"name":"Luigi's Mansion Beta Restoration (+) Plus","summary":null,"genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Portable Productions"],"publishers":["Portable Productions"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Nintendo GameCube"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7l59.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":131357,"name":"Lucky Night: Poker Games","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":121221,"name":"Lull Aby","summary":"Lull Aby: dreamland adventure — a charming puzzle adventure with unique game mechanics, enchanting atmosphere and thoughtful plot related to a vital social issue. \n \n2018 Indie Prize Finalist.

It has virtually no story and relies entirely on exploration and strategic combat. Set in a medieval world with little to no distinguishing characteristics, \"Lunatic Dawn\" throws the player immediately into the game world, which is open for him to explore. The player is able to choose the main character's gender, race (human, elf, etc.), class, and even age - older characters are more powerful, but have a more limited play time.\n\nIndeed, the entire gameplay process is timed. Traveling to a remote city or dungeon can take up to several game days. The player has to provide sufficient food for his party during this time. Player party consists of pre-generated characters, who have different names and belong to different races and classes, but have virtually no personality. Food and other supplies can be acquired in towns, through which the player moves in a Wizardry-like fashion - viewing locations from first-person perspective and selecting menu commands.\n\nWhen the party enters a dungeon, the view switches to isometric. The dungeons are large and maze-like, with enemies visible on screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a battle initiates. The battles are turn-based but fast-paced, reminding somewhat the Infinity Engine battles from Baldur's Gate series. The participants can freely move on the battle field. The player directly controls only the main characters, but can assign general commands to the party members.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Artdink"],"publishers":["NEC"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":785635200,"platforms":["PC-FX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coar6v.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":305760,"name":"Lust for Lucre","summary":"Lust For Lucre is a fantasy-themed match-3 dating sim combining strip monster battles and dungeon exploration.

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends.\nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether.\nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.","genres":["Music","Puzzle"],"developers":["Gameloft","Q Entertainment"],"publishers":["Gameloft","Bandai","WildTangent","Q Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":85.0,"release_date":1102809600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","PlayStation Portable","Xbox 360","Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co53gv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":292998,"name":"Luffi: Homebound","summary":"Luffi is returning home from time away at Hartfer's Art Academy.

Control of the plane is often based on short bursts of thrusts and it can only shoot in the direction it is facing with an unlimited number of bullets. The game consists of several levels that are won by achieving one of three win conditions, for instance killing a certain number of fighters, boats, general enemies or reaching a certain score. Combat encourages risks to build up combos. Health is represented through the border surrounding the game's screen. When it is black the plane is in good health, but when the plane is hit the border flashes, turns red and the colour then changes back to black gradually. When hit with a red border already present the plane blows up.\n\nBetween missions it is possible to unlock upgrades for the body, engine and weapons in the hangar. There are five upgrades for each type. Each combination of any upgrade leads to a new ship configuration but also to a remix of the game's soundtrack, so every tweak provides variety in the music as well. The mission objectives are also tailored to the chosen upgrades. There are 125 weapon combinations and 60 missions in total.\n\nThe game was made available both as a digital download and as a cartridge. The game is PAL only with compatibility for C64, C128 and C64GS. The music was composed for the more recent 8580 SID chip.

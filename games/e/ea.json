[{"igdb_id":574,"name":"Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard","summary":"Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard is a third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.\n\nEat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a \"legendary\" gaming hero who is \"returning to glory\" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious \"comeback\" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley.\n\nThe game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]\n\nThe cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Vicious Cycle Software"],"publishers":["D3 Publisher"],"aggregated_rating":46.25,"release_date":1235606400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4yqa.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"23974","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-23974/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"21723","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"xbox36066acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802445007eb","url":"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Eat-Lead/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802445007eb"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802445007eb","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/Eat-Lead/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802445007eb"}]},{"igdb_id":2007,"name":"East vs. West: A Hearts of Iron Game","summary":"A grand strategy game based on the Hearts of Iron franchise, focusing on the Cold War.

The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.\n\nIn 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. \nThe human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.\n\nThe 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECTThe year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States are preparing themselves for the last all-encompassing battle, work is being feverishly carried out on a secret project on the Moon. Only the code name of this project is known ………… \"SUNLIGHT\"EARTH 2150: LOST SOULSIt is the 7th of December 2150 – in a few hours our beloved planet Earth will no longer exist.\nDevastating wars between the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States have wreaked havoc and caused mortal wounds to our planet, but that is not all, a series of nuclear explosions close to the Antarctic had changed the Earth’s orbit around the sun, glaciers melted, the sea rose to a threatening level, and meteorite showers buried whole parts of the world. Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe.

It would feature characters seen earlier in the franchise, including Queen Slug-for-a-Butt as an enemy, Peter Puppy as an ally, and Princess What's-Her-Name as a love interest for Jim. Billy the Bin would also make a reappearance as one of the bosses.\n\nBy August 2006, Earthworm Jim PSP was reportedly at 80% complete, and more complete gameplay was shown in Las Vegas. Many video game journalists had hands-on playable builds of the game, such as GameSpot, GamesRadar, and IGN.\n\nEarthworm Jim PSP was initially scheduled for a late 2006 release, but this was pushed back to early 2007. When the time came around, the release was extended again to mid-year 2007. This caused concern for expectant fans, since the game had already been delayed once already.\n\nIn response to this fan concern, Andrew Yoon of PSP Fanboy contacted Alissa Bell from Atari, who confirmed the game had been shelved, commenting: \"I believe EWJ PSP is off the roster. May be revisited in the future, but the title is, as I hear it, on hold.\"\n\nFans were generally excited about the Earthworm Jim revival, which makes it surprising why Atari would stall the project. The complicated transfer of Shiny Entertainment from Interplay to Foundation 9, and merging with The Collective to form Double Helix, may have been a contributing factor in the decision to cancel the game.\n\nAccording to Dave Perry, it was due to both Atari and Interplay's financial difficulties, and a row over royalties between Shiny, Interplay, and Atari.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Shiny Entertainment"],"publishers":["Interplay Entertainment","Atari"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4042.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":143864,"name":"Earthlingo","summary":"Earthlingo is a vocabulary learning game.

The damage caused by the long wars led both world powers to evacuate the population to recently built underground cities.\n\nAustralia and most parts of Africa were sacrificed during the long wars, which lasted several decades. Highly toxic biological and chemical weapons were developed on these continents, leaving them so badly contaminated, that no human life can survive there. Not even the use of robots and machines is possible. The general opinion was that these continents would forever remain uninhabitable, and they were wiped from every map. Most of the world's population forgot that this land ever existed.\n\nNatural resources are becoming scarce and have to be extracted above ground. There have been a number of small conflicts between the UCS and the ED, the last of which escalated and became a fierce and bitter war - the final world war. Only one side can win. This final war will decide who will get the last of the available natural resources and ultimately rule the world.\n\nEARTH 2140 is a real time strategy game involving the high tech warfare of the 22nd century.

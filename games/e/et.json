[{"igdb_id":3907,"name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","summary":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem is a psychological horror action adventure, released in 2002 by Nintendo for the Gamecube. It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.\n\nThe game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.\n\nEternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Silicon Knights"],"publishers":["Nintendo","Gradiente"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":1024790400,"platforms":["Nintendo GameCube"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1sa8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":4477,"name":"Eternal Champions","summary":"Sega released Eternal Champions for their Mega Drive/Genesis in 1993, hoping to capitalize on the fighting game mania that the game industry was in the midst of following the massive success of Street Fighter II (1991) and Mortal Kombat (1992).

There is also another game mode called Flood, which involves fending off waves of demons and sealing the gates through which they come. This is primarily a multiplayer mode, but it can also be played with friendly bots.\n\nThe game's setting has strong medieval fantasy motives. The eight weapons at the player's disposal either come from a medieval arsenal (dagger, crossbow, sword) or are various holy spells like Smite and Trinity Blast which are powered by manna. Essentially, most weapons function similarly to those of Quake. However, each also has an alternate firing mode that can be toggled at any time. Alternate attacks deal more damage at the cost of increased ammo consumption.\n\nThe monsters also have medieval fantasy designs, sometimes reminiscent of Heretic or Hexen. These include zombies, levitating necromancers and various humanoid fighters in medieval attire. Many of the enemies have special abilities and alternate attacks, making them even more dangerous.\n\nOne special feature unique to Eternal War is the player's ability to pray, which allows Mike to regain full health. It is not possible to fight while praying, but the player is surrounded by an aura that will banish any demons that might try to attack him.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Two Guys Software, Ltd."],"publishers":["Two Guys Software, Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1045353600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3jeg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":142954,"name":"ET: Legacy","summary":"ET: Legacy is an open source project that aims to create a fully compatible client and server for the popular online FPS game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1356912000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaboh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":143526,"name":"Eterspire","summary":"Eterspire is a unique fantasy mobile MMORPG set apart by a gripping battle, loot, upgrade progression system that relies purely on your skill and dedication.

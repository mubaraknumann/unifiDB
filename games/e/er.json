The games were released on November 14, 2006 in the United States of America, on November 24, 2006 in European[2] and on November 23, 2006 in Australia[3] in order to coincide with the release of the film. In the game the player takes on the role of the protagonist from the book and film, Eragon, and occasionally controls his dragon Saphira. \n \nThe game was generally received poorly by critics, usually receiving press averages around the 4-6 out of 10 region (or the equivalent).[4][5] The combined sales in North America were over 400,000 copies.[6]","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Stormfront Studios","Amaze Entertainment"],"publishers":["Vivendi Universal Games"],"aggregated_rating":54.125,"release_date":1163462400,"platforms":["Xbox","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation Portable","Xbox 360","Game Boy Advance","Nintendo DS","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ouo.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2504","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-2504/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"xbox36066acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802565507e0","url":"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Eragon/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802565507e0"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"24500","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-24500/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"24499","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-24499/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802565507e0","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/Eragon/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802565507e0"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"22509","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-22509/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2298","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Eragon"}]},{"igdb_id":8340,"name":"Eradicator","summary":"Explode into action!

Still, his dream is to get a job at an eroge studio in hopes of creating what he loves, eroge. \n \nTomoya's luck takes a turn for the better when he sees a help wanted ad for the local studio Flower, and after a meeting with the company president (who to his surprise looks like an elementary school kid), manages to get a job as administrator of the company's website. Tomoya's glee at being part of the eroge industry is short-lived, as he soon learns that Flower is on the chopping block due to their first title being a massive failure. \n \nAfter playing through Flower's first title, Tomoya realizes that his co-workers don't know anything about eroge, lacking the insight and understanding needed to make a good game. After some nudging from the president of Flower's parent company and some soul searching of his own, our protagonist takes it upon himself to save Flower by teaching the four girls on staff the ins and outs of what makes an eroge good. The story thus focuses on Tomoya's role as a psuedo-consultant while getting to know the four heroines of the story as the player is given an interesting look at the world of eroge development.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":["CLOCKUP team.ANISE","CLOCKUP team.ANISE"],"publishers":["MangaGamer","CLOCKUP team.ANISE","HOBIBOX Co., Ltd.","AiCherry","AiCherry","HOBIBOX Co., Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1277424000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1v9n.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":127883,"name":"Errand Boy","summary":"A fantastical action adventure game told through 5 interweaving adventures and heroes with one overall purpose: Save the town from the imminent disaster.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Tree Interactive"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2f7o.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":129311,"name":"Era of Survival","summary":"Era of Survival is an open world multiplayer survival game currently in Early Access","genres":["Simulator","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1581897600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2lps.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":130906,"name":"Erst Kerf","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5bul.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"75212","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-75212/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"514357","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Erst%20Kerf"}]},{"igdb_id":134673,"name":"Erth","summary":"Erth is a large 2D Sandbox RPG Exploration Top-Down Turn-Based Adventure game where you explore an infinite world socializing, exploring, fighting, mining and building!

The hero in this game possesses a magical mirror with which he witnesses a duel between his best friend and an unsympathetic aristocrat. After accidentally killing his opponent, he is taken prisoner by the royal guard. The friend now tries to get him freed, but first he has to do a number of quests for the king before his plea will be heard.\n\nThe characters are controlled just like in an RTS or many Western RPGs of that era, for example Baldur's Gate. It's always reccomended to turn on the AI, as manual combat controls are terribly unresponsive. Unfortunately, the gameplay is really slow, and there's not much for the player to do while waiting till the heroes reach the end of a map or kill the inventively designed monsters. Characters can run, but only until their stamina runs out, which happens all too quickly.\n\nThe dialogues in Eryner are fully voiced, and interestingly there are even English subtitles, although they're apparently not translated by a native speaker and completely ignore linebreak rules, and it doesn't seem like the game has ever been published in an English speaking country. Never mind though, because the shoddy QA makes it very much unplayable. The fact that the installation simply doesn't work on modern systems can be worked around, not so much the many severe bugs like missing background graphics, crashes, broken save games and—worst of all—crucial events that just won't be triggered.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Jamie System Development"],"publishers":["Multi Plus"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yqo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":147552,"name":"Eruption","summary":"This is a fantasy based on reality, also a memory and adventure.

It belongs to the fantasy genre and was the first fantasy game published by Infocom after the Zork trilogy (it was originally intended to be Zork IV). The game had a parser that understood over 700 words, making it the most advanced interactive fiction game of its time. It was Infocom's ninth game.\n\nKrill, an incredibly powerful evil warlock, is spreading chaos and destruction. None of the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters dare to attempt to stop him. In desperation, the player, a novice Enchanter with only a few weak spells in his spell book, is sent in hopes that Krill will either fail to detect him or dismiss him as harmless. More powerful spells can be found on scrolls hidden in various locations, but as the player becomes more of a threat, Krill will respond accordingly.\n\nThis game features an innovative new spell system based partially on Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series and partially Dungeons and Dragons' Vancian spell system, where spells must be prepared through \"memorization\" before being cast. As in the Earthsea series, each spell is represented by some nonsense \"magic word\" which is treated as a verb by the game's text parser, so that one can use the FROTZ spell (which causes objects to glow and give off light) by typing >FROTZ BOOK, in exactly the same way as one might type >PICK UP BOOK or >READ BOOK.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Infocom"],"publishers":["Infocom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":431222400,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit","Commodore C64/128/MAX","TRS-80 Color Computer","Atari ST/STE","Mac","DOS","Amiga","Apple II","TRS-80","Amstrad CPC","Amstrad PCW"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5b80.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":350251,"name":"Entering Host","summary":"Take control of a robotic parasite caught in a massive conflict between man and machine.

It has (almost) everything we’ve ever wanted to experience in a game like this – a non-linear campaign, deep tactical gameplay, resource management, destructible environment and a sh*tload of different weapons. The only thing we are sparing for the future (when we have moar moneys) will be role-playing and a dynamic open ended campaign.\n\nTurn-based strategy is a thinking man’s game. You analyze your enemy for weak spots, think your moves ahead and execute them. No matter what is happening, you’ll have the time to think about your next move. Maybe it’s because we are too old to master Counter Strike, or because we suck at quick time events, but nevertheless, we think that this is the way it should be.\n\nEnd State has been under development as a hobbyist project already for a decade and has seen multiple revisions, each being more advanced and more fun than the previous one. While we are targeting a more hardcore audience, the game should still be accessible enough for anyone to learn. We sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy playing it as much as we do.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nTake command of a ragtag mercenary team with multiple characters with custom skill sets and weapons, facing a variety of enemies with different capabilities and weaknesses. Plan your moves in variable terrain that forces you to consider about character positioning. Directional facing matters and characters can peek around the corners. This is important because the “fog of war” only shows what the units actually see.\n\nUse cover for your benefit and aim your shots at specific body parts for different results. Face varying missions with different objectives ranging from planting a tracking device to releasing hostages and the enemy AI will, of course, act according to their separate motives.\n\nManage your team through a non-linear campaign. Recruit mercs, equip them and upgrade their skills as they gain more experience. The campaign is not linear, and in one playthrough you’ll never see everything the game has to offer. We aim to develop a future classic you can enjoy for years to come.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Indie"],"developers":["Iron Sight"],"publishers":["Iron Sight"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1669852800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pr2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":264921,"name":"Entities","summary":"Dive into horror in Entities.

The interactive FMV component uses gameplay identical to an earlier Warp game, D.\n\nThe real time component of E0 is unique. Enemies are invisible, and location is only possible through the use of sound, with notes of different pitch helping the player find the distance and direction of enemies. Additionally, every gun in the game must be charged up immediately before each shot, and charging a shot for too long will cause the charge to dissipate, after which the charging must start over. Since all available guns have very limited range, this makes timing crucial; beginning to charge the gun too late or too soon will allow the enemy to reach Laura, resulting in an immediate game over.\n\nIn Enemy Zero, reloading the gun and moving the character around are mechanics that have been made intentionally slow,[4] which stimulates players to avoid combat and direct contact with the alien enemies as much as possible. In the early segments of the game, avoiding detection is not only recommended; it is required, since the player has no means to defend him or herself without a gun. Enemy Zero is an example of a game containing stealth elements[5] roughly two years before the release of Metal Gear Solid popularized the genre worldwide, though ten years after Metal Gear started the genre in 1987.","genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"developers":["WARP"],"publishers":["Sega","WARP"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":850435200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2g3b.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":22820,"name":"Entombed","summary":"Hunted by some foes you have to escape a maze.","genres":["Strategy","Tactical","Arcade"],"developers":["Western Technologies Inc."],"publishers":["U.S. Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":415324800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/essgvbvar0mbgoqs39xh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":300460,"name":"Engage","summary":"Engage is a first person shooter made in flash.\nYou were engaged for combat missions in a research operation on the island full of huge flying creatures.\nEnter a free-fire zone where anything that moves is a legit target.

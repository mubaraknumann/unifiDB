The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\".\n\nElite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game Star Trader. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Acornsoft","Frontier Developments","David Braben","Ian Bell"],"publishers":["Hybrid Technology","Firebird","Merlin Software U.K.","Imagineer","Acornsoft","Digital Integration","Acornsoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":464486400,"platforms":["Acorn Archimedes","BBC Microcomputer System","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","Acorn Electron","DOS","Tatung Einstein","Amiga","Apple II","Amstrad CPC","Nintendo Entertainment System","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2k3w.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":339742,"name":"Eloquent","summary":"This game transports you to a world brimming with retro charm, featuring classic pixel art that is vibrant and rich in detail, inviting exploration around every corner.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1733443200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9nqm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":101044,"name":"Electric RC Sim","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":339733,"name":"Elemental Defender","summary":"Elemental Defender is a tower defense game using card to power up your units.

The game follows the stories of Blazing Sword’s cast between the end of Blazing Sword and the beginning of its Japanese-only follow-up, Fire Emblem: Binding Blade. It was originally inspired by the BSFE games, and Arch’s personal reading of 1001 Arabian Nights (hence the title).\n\nThe story centers around several different “tales,” which are are similar to a standard Fire Emblem chapter. The main difference, however, is that each tale is completely independent. The cast of the first tale will not carry over into the second, and while some do link together (for example, Tales 1, 2, and 3 provide the backdrop for Tale 5’s events), the plots are independent of each other. At the center of the game is a hub, the “Tale Select,” which also grants access to view Achievements, Bonus Content, toggle the difficulty settings, and, of course, choose a tale to play/replay.\n\nThe classic Fire Emblem elements are all intact. Each unit has a personality and a story which contributes their unique characteristics to the overall tale. Although unit deaths are not permanent (if a unit dies in a tale, when you replay that tale the character will return), the tactical choices you make have an effect on the outcome of the stories. All of Blazing Sword’s surviving playable cast (and some of its non-playable cast) make an appearance, with some guest appearances by Binding Blade and Immortal Sword characters.\n\nElibean Nights features a total of 16 playable maps, 19 achievements, and plenty of new story content.

Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory.

Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.\n\nThanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game!

However, before facing this final challenge, the player character is tested by the King. They are tasked with entering the dungeon beneath the castle and retrieving important quest items.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Sculptured Software"],"publishers":["Electro Brain"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":688953600,"platforms":["Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co61vi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":329588,"name":"Elevator Music","summary":"You make the elevator go up, go down, go fast, and go slow.

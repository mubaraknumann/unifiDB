The joystick can be used to raise and lower the blinds by pushing up or down. When the blinds are raised a nicely done sunset is visible out the window. The story behind the Venetian Blind demo is rather interesting.\n\nIt was not released publicly until 2003, as part of Activision Anthology for Windows, macOS, and Game Boy Advance. It was later released in 2010 through the Game Room retrogaming service for Windows, Xbox 360, and Windows Phone 7.\n\nAs most people know, Activision was founded by several ex-Atari employees who had left due to Atari's policies on programmer recognition (or the lack thereof). One of these employees was Bob Whitehead, creator of the \"Venetian Blinds\" technique, which was first used in Atari's Video Chess to display eight objects in a row instead of the normal six. Even though Activision had never used the Venetian Blinds technique in any of their games, that didn't stop Atari from threatening to sue Activision for \"stealing\" the technique along with other various proprietary information. Since Activision knew that they hadn't stolen anything from Atari, they decided to play a little joke on Atari. According to David Crane, when the Atari's lawyers questioned them about the \"stolen\" Venetian Blinds technique David showed them this demo and said \"Is this what you guys are referring to?\". Apparently Atari wasn’t in a laughing mood, and they went through with the lawsuit. In the end Atari ended up losing the case and Activision went on to become the most successful of the 2600 third party companies.\n\nAlthough Activision never made a game out of this demo it didn't go completely to waste. The sunset was later used in the background of Barnstorming.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ubv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":387672,"name":"Venison County","summary":"Grab your sawed-off, cast some sigils, and face the never ending nightmare head on in Venison County.

If a single player plays in this mode the game provides three opponents but the game caters for up to ten players with the game providing the additional AI opponents. Roulette,Video Poker, and Slot Machines in this game mode are played within a split screen.\n\nIn Free mode there are no computer opponents and the games are the same as the games played in Ranking mode though there are minor differences, such as selecting which slot machine to play, because in this mode the split screen mode is not used at all.\n\nThere are three kinds of slot machine which can be played for different stakes. Keno is the odd game here because it does not appear on the game menu, instead during any game other than Video Poker a casino hostess pops up in her own little window inviting the player to a game of Keno. If the player accepts they are shown a Keno card on which they mark their numbers after which their current game of Baccarat, Roulette or whatever resumes. A short while later the hostess window opens up again and the hostess gives the good, or more usually bad, news on how good their selections were.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Coconuts Japan"],"publishers":["Coconuts Japan","Midas Interactive Entertainment","Success"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":842572800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Sega Saturn","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob4bf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":127093,"name":"Veggie Killer Remastered","summary":"Do you know this?

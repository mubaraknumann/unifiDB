Duck Hunt, and is included in the PlayChoice-10 arcade console, an arcade machine with as many as 10 different games previously available only on the NES. The console supports two light guns, allowing two players at once.\n\nGameplay consists of alternating rounds with 12 ducks/targets per round instead of 10 and sometimes requires the player to shoot three ducks/targets at a time instead of two. In addition, the player is given a limited number of lives; every duck/target that is not hit costs one life. When all lives are gone, the game ends.\n\nAfter every second round, a bonus stage is played in which ducks can be shot for points as they fly out of the grass. However, the hunting dog occasionally jumps out, putting himself in the line of fire and creating a distraction. If the player shoots the dog, the bonus stage immediately ends.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Nintendo"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":449625600,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ste.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":338559,"name":"V-Shift","summary":"V-Shift is a high-intensity, fast-paced, battle platformer where mastering your movement is key to victory.

The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.\n\nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.\n\nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost.\n\nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt. A later version of the game was released which eliminated the contest levels and stars.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Atari Games","Atari Games"],"publishers":["Atari Games","Tengen","Tengen","Domark"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":599529600,"platforms":["Arcade","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","Amiga","Amstrad CPC","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6oy0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12901,"name":"Viper","summary":"A minigame collection based on the popular screensaver software","genres":["Shooter","Strategy","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":["X-Ample Architectures"],"publishers":["Ocean Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":899251200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rykiklkju8mkimj8u7lc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":13261,"name":"Virtual Golf","summary":null,"genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vip0l27ga6s2zpouwqhs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":14909,"name":"Virtual Villagers: A New Home","summary":"Care for and nurture a tribe of little people by teaching them the basics of survival.

Once that round of betting is done, players can then choose to discard up to three of their cards in exchange for new ones, in an attempt to make a better hand. Another round of betting then takes place and, after that, all the players that didn't fold must show their cards. Whoever has the highest hand wins all the money in the pot.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Zircon International"],"publishers":["Zircon International"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":378604800,"platforms":["Fairchild Channel F"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/puasrtnp0gaxu1jiblnm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1576686194","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Videocart-25%3A%20Casino%20Poker"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"26684","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-26684/"}]},{"igdb_id":18604,"name":"Videocart-26: Alien Invasion","summary":"In this Space Invaders variant, the player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen and fires missiles at incoming alien ships.

The level design is particularly creative, along with a unique charge shot and bombs. It gets its name from the Sanskrit word for \"Flying Machine\", described in Sanskrit Epics. The storyline involves a planet being attacked by seemingly indestructible alien forces that induce fear and insanity to all that oppose them. The last hope for this planet is the Vimana Warriors, two ships that are empowered by the Hindu god Ganesha to defend against the aliens and restore peace to the galaxy.\n\nThe Vimana warriors are the player one and player two ships, each equipped with a shot that charges in the shape of a V. Once the shot is released, the V shape explodes forth in an arc, hitting almost everything in front of it. This sounds like it would be a very powerful weapon, but this leads to Vimana's main problem - none of your attacks ever do enough damage. Even the weakest enemies will take more than a few hits to destroy, even if your weapon is fully powered up. Bombs are similarly underwhelming, consisting of seven balls of light that rotate around your ship and guard you from shots. Once an enemy comes onto screen, a light ball will jump out from the group and crash into the enemy, likely destroying or heavily damaging it. Unlike in Fire Shark, where you can pick up new weapons, Vimana does not offer any weapons other than standard shots, charge shots, and bombs.\n\nVimana has some bits of creativity in its levels. One in particular has moving enemy searchlights, which will fire hard to dodge bullets if it spots you. An interesting boss fires from the bottom of the screen as opposed to the top. Vimana also attempts to squeeze around 50 enemy bullets on screen at once, making it feel like a sort of prototype bullet hell shooter.\n\nVimana was never ported to any home systems, but like Out Zone it would not have really fit onto any of them very well. The music was done by Toshiaki Tomizawa, who would later go on to make soundtracks for Fixeight, another Toaplan shooter and many of Cave's games, including Dodonpachi, Progear, Guwange, and ESP Ra.

The player loses a life if he happens to miss hitting the ball with his paddle and it falls into the abyss. The game ends when 7 balls are lost.

It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the \"Virtua\" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. An alternate box mock-up uses the title Virtual Hamster instead.\n\nIn August 2009, Ryo Suzuki of SEGASaturno.com dumped an early prototype version of this game. In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other characters and items dotted around the map). A resets the game, and B/C can be used to move the camera forwards and backwards through the tube.

It is the first entry in the franchise of the same name.\n\nIn Vid Grid, the players have to resolve and finish a jigsaw puzzle in time as their main objective, before the music video that is being played on the background ends. Conceived by Geffen executive Norman Beil and produced in conjunction with Jasmine Multimedia as a joint-venture, the game was one of the first titles to use Microsoft's Video for Windows multimedia framework, which allowed to play and encode digital video up to a maximum resolution of 320x240 pixels.\n\nThe game includes a total of 10 music videos of different rock genres (including grunge rock from Soundgarden and Nirvana, hard rock from Van Halen and Aerosmith, and heavy metal from Ozzy Osbourne and Metallica). During each puzzle, the video itself is chopped up into a grid and each piece is scrambled. As the video plays, players must reassemble the pieces to its original form. As players progress through the game, each puzzle gets progressively tougher to solve (including larger amounts of pieces, different puzzle requirements, and flipped videos).\n\nThe game received two spin-off titles: Country Vid Grid (for country music videos) and Kid Vid Grid (for cartoons).","genres":["Music","Puzzle"],"developers":["Geffen Records"],"publishers":["Jasmine Multimedia Publishing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":779414400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Atari Jaguar","Atari Jaguar CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p8u.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":71362,"name":"Virtual Pool 2","summary":"Virtual Pool 2 is the second game in the franchise.","genres":["Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Celeris"],"publishers":["VR Sports","Interplay Productions"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":879984000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7xwk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":71929,"name":"Virtual Murder 2: The Magic Death","summary":"The Magic Death: Virtual Murder 2 is a video game published in 1993 on Windows 3.x by Creative Multimedia Corporation.

Well played, people!*\n*Whoa! You made us #1 in Simulation! Thanks, we love you people!*\n\nA note from the developer:\n\nHi, and thanks for taking a look at Virtual Families 2! We have been working on it for quite a while, and we’re very happy to be able to finally share this new chapter with everyone.\n\nBefore you skip down to the bullet points and screenshots, let me say a few quick words about this game, and life simulations in general: I love life simulation games. I have always been passionate about designing them, and almost everything that comes out of Last Day of Work is a life sim of some kind. This one, in particular, thrills me so much because it is designed to have a life of its own: unpredictable and so different each time I play it, and each time another player plays it. I love that the story unfolds differently for everyone who plays it, and your experience with the game might be wildly different from your friends’ experience.\n\nDesigning this type of game, however, has its own special challenges. The main challenge is that EVERYTHING in life is a great idea to add to a game like this. There are SO many great ideas, and we simply cannot put them all in at launch. So, while I hope the game captivates you as much as it does us, there will inevitably be things that you feel are missing and you would love to see added (tell us!).\n\nWe plan to update the content in this game. We want to add pets, hidden puzzles, more storyline, more events, tons of new things to buy, and the list goes on and on. We will also continue to tune and deepen all the game's inner workings that control happiness, health, and everything else. While the game has been balanced to be playable for free and without purchasing anything, we hope that you will find something compelling enough in the game to give us support so that we can continue to create fun new updates.\n\nEnjoy Virtual Families 2! Please visit our Facebook page and our forums to give your own amazing ideas and suggestions, and don’t forget to check in on your little family or they will get very sad. :)\n\nWith sincere gratitude, \nArthur Humphrey\nLead Designer, Last Day of Work\n\n\nVirtual Families 2 has all this and more:\n\n* Adopt a little person and start a family. Make babies and pass the house on to the kids!\n\n* Train your little people to behave as you wish by praising and scolding them.\n\n* Your little people will send you messages, thanking, pleading, and praising you for caring for them.\n\n* Runs in True Real Time. Your little people continue to live, eat, grow, and work when the app is switched off.\n\n* Your little family is in your time zone! Is it getting dark where you live? Your little family is probably getting ready for bed then...\n\n* Highly varied, unpredictable game play. No two games run the same. \n\n* Make babies. Cure illnesses. Help nurture and guide generations of your family.\n\n* Restore the house. Finish and fix rooms. Shop and decorate.\n\n\nRecommended for people who enjoy Virtual Villagers and other life simulation games!\n\nVisit our Official Virtual Families site at www.VirtualFamilies.com for instructions, strategy guides, and much more! \n\nLDW games have been awarded with:\n\n* Sim Game of the Year – Game Tunnel\n* The Zeebys – Gamezebo\n* Parents Choice Recommended Award\n* iParenting Media Award\n\nCheck out our other hit games like Virtual Town, Fish Tycoon, Virtual Villagers, and more at https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ldw-software-llc/id297606729","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Last Day of Work"],"publishers":["Last Day of Work"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1354752000,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2n8x.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"695381652","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Virtual%20Families%202%3A%20Our%20Dream%20House"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"873970","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/873970"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"575271654","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/virtual-families-2-our-dream-house/id575271654?mt=8&uo=4"}]},{"igdb_id":88634,"name":"Virtual City Playground","summary":"Build a city worthy of your wildest and most ambitious dreams ... and manage it in Virtual City Playground!","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["G5E"],"publishers":["G5E"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1319068800,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1lb5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":88823,"name":"Viking Village","summary":"RTS/RPG Hybrid: Play offline or play online 1v1 multiplayer!","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1524528000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":89227,"name":"Virtual Pet Kitty Cat","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":89373,"name":"Viarkanoid","summary":"Experience Viarkanoid, the new virtual reality update of the classic 80s arcade game Arkanoid.

The defeated participant thinks that she was unfairly judged, but her fury at the winner turns, in front of the amazed spectators, into erotic desire...\n\nDouble Impact features two young female detectives, Miho and Kumi, who pretend to search for jobs as maids in order to infiltrate a mansion in which mysterious disappearances have been taking place.\n\nAll the three stories are very short and can perhaps be better described as \"scenes\"; the entire game can be completed within several minutes. The interaction is reduced to absolute minimum, with an occasion decision to make, and is available only in The Devil Came (in which it is also possible to die if the player makes a wrong decision); the two other stories are non-interactive, the only input being pressing the return key to advance to the next scene.

While exploring the Palenque ruins in southern Mexico, the player takes the role of an archeologist where they use the game's katakana text parser to interact with the world and solve puzzles. The game was technically impressive for its time due to how quickly it could load new images, similar to Falcom's Demons Ring, and for its use of digitized photographs for some of its graphics.\n\nAsteka was most likely released on April 13, 1985 according to early advertisements. However, even Falcom contradicts itself on the title's exact publication date.

Indeed, this extraordinary cartridge designed for GameBoy Advance offers the lucky player two games for the price of one.\n\nAllow us to introduce the one on the right, inspired by Asterix and Cleopatra. Your mission, as you control our two heroes, is to help Edifis with the construction of a palace for Cleopatra. Mainly, you'll be defending him from the vile stratagems of his rival Artifis and Caesar's watchful legions.\n\nIn the game on my left, \"Asterix and Obelix,\" the idea is to bring souvenirs from every country in the Roman Empire to Julius Caesar, who deluded himself into thinking he could confine our indomitable Gauls to their village. Hang onto your helmet as your package tour, eventful as ever, takes you to see the wonders of (Great) Brittany, Helvetia, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Spain.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Bit Managers"],"publishers":["Atari Europe","Infogrames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1012348800,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9q8q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":374362,"name":"Ashbound Expanse","summary":"This is a fast-paced first-person and third-person shooter that blends roguelike elements, offering easy-to-learn mechanics, satisfying controls, and intense gunplay.

Assassin was updated and re-released in 1994 as Assassin: Special Edition. Assassin's storyline is fairly simple. The character is an assassin that has been hired to kill the antagonist of the game, \"Midan\". He is then dropped behind enemy lines and must first disable Midan's power source, and then assassinate him. The assassin is armed with a boomerang that is razor-edged. There are three skill levels to Assassin, Rookie, Arcade and Ultimate. As well as changing the difficulty, each level unlocks more of the game than the level that is easier than it. The enemies are tougher to defeat in the higher levels, but there are more rewards. The player must guide the assassin through the levels facing enemies ranging from vicious dogs to wall mounted laser cannons. As well as the platforms, the player is able to control the assassin to climb on walls and ceilings as a method of getting around, and avoiding enemies. The player can use the boomerang to attack enemies, or use bonus weapons that are gained by achieving certain requirements. The whole game is controlled by a joystick. Assassin: Special Edition was released 2 years after the original game and various gameplay elements were altered. The first level is gone which means that there no longer are the dogs as enemies, also the boomerang has been replaced with a laser gun.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Psionic Systems"],"publishers":["Team17"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725760000,"platforms":["Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qduh4tp2dkf4wullu7qq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":169994,"name":"Asterigos: Curse of the Stars","summary":"Embark on a journey full of danger in this action RPG, inspired by Greek and Roman mythologies.

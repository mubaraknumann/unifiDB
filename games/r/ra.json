The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously. Rainbows are now broken by pressing the stylus onto them.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Dreams"],"publishers":["Codemasters"],"aggregated_rating":50.0,"release_date":1162512000,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2hhi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":22819,"name":"Raft Rider","summary":"White water everywhere!

Help Mervyn seek out the evil warlocks and destroy their mis-shapen guardian hordes. \nBlast their looming weapon generators and defeat the warlocks themselves in ritual magic combat... and if you have enough strength after all that - who knows, you might succeed in turning him back into a human Mervyn - el Wimpo or Rambo? Only if he gets the right potion!! \nThe aim of the game is to start on the top level of the dungeon and defeat each warlock that you encounter. Each warlock is guarded by groups of evil creatures - You earn extra points for destroying these creatures, but they do not affect the main course of the game. Some of the rooms in the dungeon contain tomb-like weapon generators which create vicious weapons such as spinning knives. Destruction of the weapons earns you nothing but you can shoot the generators for extra points. \nSome rooms also have mysterious symbols embedded in the floor. The symbols are called Floor Glyphs and are of four different types. One type is used to weave magic spells, another may be fired to destroy some or all your enemies in the room. The other two types are used to reveal a plan of the current level of the dungeon or to transport you to a new level. When you defeat a warlock you should strive to capture the magic runes which he releases because you may then use them to conjure spells to make yourself stronger in attack and less vulnerable in defence. When you have cleared the top level of the dungeon you will be strong enough to proceed downwards to tackle the more aggressive warlocks and their guardian creatures which lurk below.","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Graftgold"],"publishers":["Hewson Consultants"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rxhwugufhr35cn9k3lie.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":30955,"name":"Raid 2000","summary":"8-way scrolling shoot-em-up with a strategic overworld map for the c64 from Mirrorsoft.","genres":["Shooter","Strategy","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Mirrorsoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oi01xsw54y7wls3qviws.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"28047","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Raid%202000"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"31144","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-31144/"}]},{"igdb_id":31002,"name":"Raging Titan","summary":"Show your tactical genius, your military leadership and your strategic thinking in this demanding fight!

Gameplay is similar to Space Invaders and Galaxian, but set in a forced perspective angle.\n\nRadar Scope was a commercial failure and created a financial crisis for the subsidiary Nintendo of America. Its president, Minoru Arakawa, pleaded for his father-in-law, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, to send him a new game that could convert and salvage thousands of unsold Radar Scope machines. This prompted the creation of Donkey Kong. Radar Scope is one of the first video game projects for artist Shigeru Miyamoto and for composer Hirokazu Tanaka.\n\nRetrospectively, critics have praised Radar Scope for its gameplay and design being a unique iteration upon the Space Invaders template. One critic labeled it one of Nintendo's most important games because its commercial failure inadvertently led to the creation of Nintendo's mascot character and helped pave the way for the company's entry into the console video game market.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Nintendo R&D2","Nintendo R&D2","Ikegami Tsushinki"],"publishers":["Nintendo","Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":341884800,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2x41.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"20776","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-20776/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"18984","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Radar%20Scope"}]},{"igdb_id":39436,"name":"Ranger Mission","summary":"A 1 to 2 player 3-D military combat shooting game where players use pump-action shotguns to shoot on-screen enemies.The game has four different missions:Jungle Mission, Desert Mission, Indoor Rescue Mission and Tundra Mission.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1075593600,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pjp30ckadl4abjuxqgxc.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"30607","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-30607/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"27583","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ranger%20Mission"}]},{"igdb_id":39469,"name":"Rail Chase 2","summary":"Rail Chase 2 is a 3D rail shooter played from a first-person perspective.

Rapid Hero is a very classic and relatively efficient shmup . At the command of a hunter who also thinks somewhat of the design of Strike Gunner STG , you will have to repel the enemy bursts avoiding of course to make you touch ... Two heroes are willing to carry out this mission, with a few minor differences in gameplay: the first aircraft is specialized in concentrated direct fire, the second in the deployed shot. Of course, the game offers you its selection of power-ups and special weapons, such as auxiliary and self-guided lasers. The course of the game is rather neat with a certain sense of staging. The big enemies arrive from afar and see their shadow emerge under a heap of clouds before presenting themselves to you is still very pleasant, as are the enemies coming out of destroyed buildings. Stage 3 is an infiltration into an enemy armada: you will see the long enemy ship scrolling from the beginning of the level, before finding it later in the level, armed and ready to fight ... In short, it is very classic As a plot, but some care has been taken in the script, which does not spoil anything. With this in mind, the boss is a small robot that returns to the end of each level with new attacks, which will put your speed to dodge and your sense of positioning to the test. Let's play the game from a more down-to-earth point of view. The graphics without being catastrophic, is not brilliant for all that; This type of visual is not without evoking the consoles 16 bits, which count among their ranks many shmups more pleasant to look. The animation is without great problem, except for a few flashes of sprites, just noted for information because they are finally quite minor. What makes the Rapid Hero's charm is actually how it forces the player to anticipate. The enemy's salvos are fast in devils and admirable in symmetry. Of course, we can predict their move to the screen, but having to deal with 5, 6 or even 7 types of enemy movements sprinkled with a few pellets requires precision in the maneuvers, and it is finally this gameplay that ensures its interest in Rapid Hero . And in case you've made a mistake, there's always the smart bomb to get you out of it ... To conclude, Rapid Hero is an honest and entertaining shmup that will hook the player without being a masterpiece of its kind. Its precise gameplay will delight fans of old school shmups who will find there the sensations of Super Nintendo and Megadrive.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":770688000,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co66oq.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"519099","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Rapid%20Hero/"}]},{"igdb_id":39947,"name":"Racing Hero","summary":"Race a motorcycle against other bikes, cars, trucks and the obligatory tight time limit.

When Remy finds himself in Paris near the restaurant of the famous deceased chef Gusteau, he works on making his dream of becoming a chef himself come true, while helping out his fellow rats to procure food.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Asobo Studio"],"publishers":["THQ"],"aggregated_rating":67.0,"release_date":1182816000,"platforms":["Xbox","Nintendo GameCube","Wii","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co891e.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":78607,"name":"Rat on the Run","summary":"Help Ratty get FATTENED UP for the winter in this hilarious platform game!\n\nRatty has just found the house of his dreams - a house full of cheese blocks and doodles.\nThere's just one big problem.

The company's latest PS2 racer, Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix, maintains many of the same gameplay mechanics that Genki's other games contain, but this time it takes the cars off of the streets and drops them onto proper racetracks.\n\nRacing Battle will contain licensed cars. The version on display only has a handful, including an RX-7, a Supra, an Integra, an Impreza, and an S2000. The car models in the game look decent. They're nice and smooth, but they don't seem to be quite as detailed as the car models in some other comparable racing games.\n\nLike most other racing games, Racing Battle has multiple camera angles. But the first-person angle is pretty interesting. From this view, you get indicators that show how hard you're steering, accelerating, or braking. You also get a second, TV-style camera angle in a small window at the top of the screen. This is cool because it gives you a good idea of what's going on near your car. It's easy to see cars coming up behind you with this view and more effective than a standard rearview mirror.\n\nThe gameplay in Racing Battle is roughly the same as what Genki has done with Shutokou and Kaido Battle series. Each car is associated with a fighting gamelike life meter, and the car in second place constantly loses pieces of its life meter. When one car runs out of \"health,\" the race ends and a winner is declared.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Genki"],"publishers":["Genki"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1117065600,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa350.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1711914059","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Racing%20Battle:%20C1%20Grand%20Prix"}]},{"igdb_id":216667,"name":"Racoonie: Legend of the Spirits","summary":"Become the Racoonie!

What originally started as a semi in-joke between friends spiraled out into a much larger project, with a much larger author pool contributing levels (for better or worse). Making this hack semi-unique in nature is, in persuit of MAXIMUM AUTHENTICITY, all tools, sprites, blocks, and music (barring resources made specifically for the project) are from 2007-2009 too. That's right, we're talking Lunar Magic 1.63, JonWill's Blktool, MikeyK's Sprite Tool 1.22, and Romi's Addmusic 4.04. Of course, this wouldn't be playable on hardware by default. To comply with SMWC standards, only the fixed version is available below (in both Japanese and English). It contains the usual modern hack fixes (FastROM, QoL adjustments, Blktool Optimizer, ect), but that doesn't mean it's any less difficult! For SNESGT and ZSNES enthusiasts, you can also play the original unfixed (Japanese) version through this handy link right here. One may be quick to compare this to one of my previous hacking endeavors, but this is a very stylistically different hack that goes in a different direction. If you were a fan of that hack, you may not be particularly pleased that it isn't a continuation / sequel, but I did try to throw a bone in a level or two. Regardless, I still expect this hack to be very difficult. An Author List for individual levels can be found here. Be mindful of spoilers!\n\nDifficulty curve is practically nonexistent, and levels explore various design styles, so you'll never know what's next. Whilst tagged as a Kaizo hack, take solace in the knowledge that this is primarily a Standard: Very (Very) Hard hack. However, because certain levels are played in a style and way agreed upon today to be \"Kaizo\" (one hit kill, levels played in a strict way, and lots of trial and error), I felt it was a necessity to tag it as such for the unwitting moderator or player who wishes to tackle such a hack.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":["SMW Central"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1654819200,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7dqd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":277199,"name":"Rage of Mages","summary":"This mobile Allods game is an absorbing step-by-step RPG in a wonderful fantasy setting revealing the prehistory of the world of Allods.

It is a physical release and an expanded version of the original \"Raid on TriCity\" that was download only.\n\nThe player controls a space ship on a playfield similar to the one of Tetris. The ship can freely be moved around the area as long as its part of a stacked block. New Tetrominoes drop down from the top of the screen. They cannot be moved or rotated, but they can be shot brick by brick. Scoring is done by creating lines, so careful shooting is required to either destroy the block completely or to make parts fit the gaps in the playfield to stack them properly and create lines. The shooting itself does not affect the score. Some of the falling blocks contain power-ups or enemies that can be destroyed or drop to add to the stack. Power-ups such as bombs can become dangerous when lines are formed and enemies restrict movement when part of the stack and can then only be taken out through lines. When the blocks reach a threshold near the top of the screen, the game is over.\n\nEEPROM on the cartridge is used to save the game and store highscores. Also new to this release is the Story mode. It splits the gameplay into separate levels with a fixed goal to complete them, a narrative about aliens where the player has to save Congis Space Station and the AC2-K11 sector of the Galaxy, and some interactivity with a branching level path. The gameplay for Story is similar to the Arcade mode but there the only goal is to beat the highscore.\n\nThe playfield only takes up about 50% of the screen in the center. On the left there is a picture showing a control element of a space ship and the right part contains the HUD elements. In the Story mode the HUD shows the remaining time, the level objective such as the number of lines, bombs and bugs, and the number of bullets you can shoot at the same time. In the Arcade mode the HUD shows the score, the number of lines, the current level and the number of bullets you can shoot at the same time.","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle"],"developers":["Fadest"],"publishers":["Yastuna Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1628812800,"platforms":["Atari Lynx"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8e4r.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1666845885","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Raid%20on%20Tri%20City:%20Second%20Wave"}]},{"igdb_id":289294,"name":"Ramshackle.Exe","summary":"RAMSHACKLE.EXE is a 3D platformer about a broken repair robot trying to save his mechanical home from a destructive VIRUS.

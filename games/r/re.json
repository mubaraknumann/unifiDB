Shaman tells the fairy accompanying him (Gigi) to choose and revive a recently killed corpse that can fight against Dalu's minions and eventually gain enough power to defeat Dalu.

Out of the four stages in the game, the first, second and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of small fry enemies: one with fewer hit points and a stronger attack (usually armed with a weapon) and one with more hit points, but with a weaker attack and the ability to grab the player from behind, making him vulnerable to other enemies' attacks.\n\nWhen only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss is defeated, any remaining enemies retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down, and brings in the normal enemies once the bikers have been defeated. The third stage is a gang of women; their boss is a very large woman who cannot easily be knocked to the ground. The fourth stage features a single type of knife-wielding enemy who can kill the player with one hit. Once the player has defeated this first wave of enemies, the main character proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next cycle with an increased difficulty.\n\nIn addition to an eight-direction joystick, there are three buttons; left attack, right attack, and jump. Pressing the attack in the direction the character is facing will punch, while attacking in the opposite direction will perform a rear kick. Jumping, followed immediately by one of the attack buttons, which will perform a jumping kick in the direction of the attack.\n\nPressing the joystick twice quickly either left or right will cause the player to run, at which point attacking in the direction of the run will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and attacking in the opposite direction will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a downed enemy will make the player sit on top of the enemy, at which point attacking toward the enemy will cause the player to pummel him. The bosses can only be sat on if all normal enemies have been defeated, and unless the boss' energy level is low enough, he'll throw the player off.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Technos Japan"],"publishers":["Arc System Works","Taito","Aksys Games"],"aggregated_rating":39.0,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS","Wii","Wii U","Nintendo Entertainment System","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co471k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"18293","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18293/"}]},{"igdb_id":6868,"name":"Reel Fishing Paradise 3D","summary":"Travel to over a dozen stunning fishing locales in your quest to become a master angler.

Not only is the puzzle difficult, but there are some red herrings that make the puzzle even harder--but it's also very satisfying when you finally do solve it. Both funny and grim--lots of amusing stuff around the edges, but the puzzle itself isn't particularly funny.

Though their numbers and armaments small, the beleaguered lunar colonists had finally reached their breaking point, and declared themselves independent of the Earth.\n\nThe United Nations, who had assumed total power over the lunar colonies, was furious and desperate at the development. The lunar colonies were absolutely necessary to feeding of the citizens of Earth, and due to this the United Nations could not possibly stand to accept anything but total victory over the Lunar Defense Force. However the LDF does not plan to lose: To them, they are fighting for their homeland and plan to defend it at all costs. That is where you come in...\n\nThe game features many different styles of mission goals: objectives ranging from sabotage (where the player must find and destroy enemy infrastructure), seek-and-destroy (where the player and other LDF soldiers must eliminate an enemy stronghold), and even defense missions (where the player and an allotment of LDF soldiers must successfully defend a Rebel objective). Depending on the type of mission, the player will be allotted a specific number of LDF soldiers in reserve to back up the player's main force. Managing the numbers of those reserve soldiers could spell victory or disaster in some missions. The player has a large arsenal of futuristic weapons at his/her disposal, ranging from laser pistols to chain-fed rail-guns and plasma rifles.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Fenris

Now a band of rebels is about to stage a coup to overturn the dictator, but they are found out and thrown into prisons throughout the country. You must now re-unite your rebels and oust Friedrich.\n\nStarting off with one rebel you must infiltrate his prison and move through six different levels helping your comrades escape. Interact with the environment like throwing objects to distract the guards. Sneak past guards because they can hear your loud footsteps if you try to run. Watch out for his \"field of vision\" as you can tell where he is looking. If you knock a guard out he will eventually come to and look for you. If you kill a guard you must hide his body to keep from raising the alarm.\n\nEvery rebel has his/her own skills like feign death to surprise the guard and overcome him. Pick locks and set traps for unsuspecting guards. Conceal yourself in shadows to hide. Disguise yourself to fool the guards and even imitate sounds to throw them off your trail. And even cast Voodoo magic to hypnotize unwary opponents.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1054425600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/blmtgjomuckh10nw3yt5.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"1658","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-1658/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1514","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Rebels%20Prison%20Escape"}]},{"igdb_id":71644,"name":"Return to Paradise Heights","summary":"Very similar to the first eroge VN but now the protagonist works in an office and just lives in Paradise Heights.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Foster"],"publishers":["Foster"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":814147200,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5rns.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"4825","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-4825/"}]},{"igdb_id":71751,"name":"Rescue from Atlantis","summary":"An action game released for many early computers.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Creepsoft"],"publishers":["Dinamic Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["ZX Spectrum","Amstrad CPC","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co675r.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"4438","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Rescue%20from%20Atlantis"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"4860","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-4860/"}]},{"igdb_id":71789,"name":"Return to Kroz","summary":"Return to Kroz is the 1st of the Super Kroz Trilogy.

The complicated part of driving is parking of course. With the rising number of cars and the lack of parking space makes, the situation even worse. This is the reason why bumps and scrapes are quite common when parking your car which really turns you off. Next time when you park somewhere, keep the following tips in mind to maintain your car properly. Follow the below parking tips in our new free 3d parking game.\n1.For parking, First and the foremost thing you need to do is to reduce the speed to minimum when you have found the place. Then, decide whether you want to go reverse or nose first. Go slowly as this greatly decreases your chance for mistake. In addition, it will get you time to think all your movements and correct your mistakes on the go you can learn this in our 3D parking simulation\n2.While parking your car, leave enough space between your car and adjacent cars. This will help the fellow drivers to move their car out of park easily and without striking yours.\n3.In packed parking lots, drivers get competitive for parking space. This can be very risky. Keeping your vehicle in control is important at all times. Don’t show an offensive behaviour while parking your vehicle. This can annoy other car drivers sharing the same parking region.\n4.Don’t ignore things that make the job of parking easier. If you’re moving backwards, turn around and look behind you; if you’re moving forward, look straight ahead of you. Also ensure that your fellow drivers are aware of your presence. Keep I mind that sometimes your fellow drivers will overlook you so keep aware anytime!","genres":["Racing","Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1805643392","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Real%20Car%20Parking%203D"}]},{"igdb_id":256500,"name":"Retro Space","summary":"In this space shooter game your goal is to destroy all the invaders and get the best score.\nInspired by a famous game (Space Impact), Retro Space has 8 levels and 8 bosses.\nWith a more colorful and modern look, you will remember what it was like to play on an old cell phone.","genres":["Shooter","Indie"],"developers":["Apps Bergman"],"publishers":["Apps Bergman"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1526256000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6qqg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":256564,"name":"Real Drift Multiplayer","summary":"Real Drift Multiplayer is a drifting game with realistic graphics and extensive customization options.

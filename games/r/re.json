Next time when you park somewhere, keep the following tips in mind to maintain your car properly. Follow the below parking tips in our new free 3d parking game.\n1.For parking, First and the foremost thing you need to do is to reduce the speed to minimum when you have found the place. Then, decide whether you want to go reverse or nose first. Go slowly as this greatly decreases your chance for mistake. In addition, it will get you time to think all your movements and correct your mistakes on the go you can learn this in our 3D parking simulation\n2.While parking your car, leave enough space between your car and adjacent cars. This will help the fellow drivers to move their car out of park easily and without striking yours.\n3.In packed parking lots, drivers get competitive for parking space. This can be very risky. Keeping your vehicle in control is important at all times. Don’t show an offensive behaviour while parking your vehicle. This can annoy other car drivers sharing the same parking region.\n4.Don’t ignore things that make the job of parking easier.

Though their numbers and armaments small, the beleaguered lunar colonists had finally reached their breaking point, and declared themselves independent of the Earth.\n\nThe United Nations, who had assumed total power over the lunar colonies, was furious and desperate at the development. The lunar colonies were absolutely necessary to feeding of the citizens of Earth, and due to this the United Nations could not possibly stand to accept anything but total victory over the Lunar Defense Force. However the LDF does not plan to lose: To them, they are fighting for their homeland and plan to defend it at all costs. That is where you come in...\n\nThe game features many different styles of mission goals: objectives ranging from sabotage (where the player must find and destroy enemy infrastructure), seek-and-destroy (where the player and other LDF soldiers must eliminate an enemy stronghold), and even defense missions (where the player and an allotment of LDF soldiers must successfully defend a Rebel objective). Depending on the type of mission, the player will be allotted a specific number of LDF soldiers in reserve to back up the player's main force. Managing the numbers of those reserve soldiers could spell victory or disaster in some missions. The player has a large arsenal of futuristic weapons at his/her disposal, ranging from laser pistols to chain-fed rail-guns and plasma rifles.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Fenris Wolf"],"publishers":["Creative Labs"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820368000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qz1.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":345432,"name":"Red Light","summary":"Red Light is a retro-styled extraction shooter where you take a mission to raid an abandoned Soviet R&D Institute filled with mercenaries and living results of human experiments to solve the mystery of your disappeared brother.","genres":["Shooter","Indie"],"developers":["LampDog Studio"],"publishers":["LampDog Studio"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1749772800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9v7r.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":147897,"name":"Retro Classix 2in1 pack: Bad Dudes & Two Crude Dudes","summary":"BAD DUDES: \"President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas.

There is a single-player campaign with unique endings for each character, as well as a 2-player split screen versus mode; the Saturn version, Hyper Reverthion, adds system link support for two-player matches between two consoles.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":817776000,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co72ks.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":241570,"name":"Rebellious Numbers","summary":"Be mad with Rebellious Numbers!\nOne second for sorting from smallest to largest or largest to smallest","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":208019,"name":"Recoil Gunner","summary":"Destroy enemies with your enhanced ship and precise shooting.\nShoot enemies while moving with the recoil of your gun, slingshot action.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":36880,"name":"Rebelstar Raiders","summary":"The original predecessor to Rebelstar.","genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Red Shift"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["ZX Spectrum"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ewxcuwrhzfnc7sjg7rqc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":298036,"name":"Resident Evil: Grim Beginnings","summary":"Welcome to Resident Evil: Grim Beginnings - an solo developed, Game Boy demake of the original Resident Evil.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Grammy_Games"],"publishers":["Grammy_Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1661990400,"platforms":["Web browser","Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9i1r.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":65812,"name":"Retro Dungeons","summary":"Indie and casual game based on completing dungeons, with old game ringtones.

Farmers from neighbouring villages and farms came on their shining machines to participate in the event. And you are one of them. Keep wining the races and soon your fame will reach other countries and you'll be able to buy new tractors to keep up with growing competition. And in the end, you'll end up entering world's best farmer competition in USA.","genres":[],"developers":["Libredia"],"publishers":["Play, Silden"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1393632000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3hgj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":29481,"name":"RealBX VR","summary":"A.

game in which you control up to five characters in an attempt to escape from prisons scattered about the country. Each character has his/her own talents and skills. Escape from the prisons using stealth to hide from the guards or bribe your way with some and overpower others.\n\nFriedrich, a cruel dictator, controls his country's people with an iron fist. Now a band of rebels is about to stage a coup to overturn the dictator, but they are found out and thrown into prisons throughout the country. You must now re-unite your rebels and oust Friedrich.\n\nStarting off with one rebel you must infiltrate his prison and move through six different levels helping your comrades escape. Interact with the environment like throwing objects to distract the guards. Sneak past guards because they can hear your loud footsteps if you try to run. Watch out for his \"field of vision\" as you can tell where he is looking. If you knock a guard out he will eventually come to and look for you. If you kill a guard you must hide his body to keep from raising the alarm.\n\nEvery rebel has his/her own skills like feign death to surprise the guard and overcome him. Pick locks and set traps for unsuspecting guards. Conceal yourself in shadows to hide. Disguise yourself to fool the guards and even imitate sounds to throw them off your trail. And even cast Voodoo magic to hypnotize unwary opponents.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1054425600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/blmtgjomuckh10nw3yt5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":133776,"name":"Red and Blue","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":259179,"name":"Residence","summary":"Kailin does her yoga training every day to stay fit for her upcoming sexfights.

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.\n\nLike Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris \"The Bear\" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.\n\nThroughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word \"RUMBLE\" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called \"Rumble Flurry\", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.\n\nOne unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game","genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"developers":["Midway"],"publishers":["Midway"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":936835200,"platforms":["Nintendo 64","PlayStation","Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3b87.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"19836","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-19836/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"18148","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ready 2 Rumble Boxing"}]},{"igdb_id":35051,"name":"Rebel Wings","summary":"Rebel Wings is a multiplayer arcade airplane shooter.

Out of the four stages in the game, the first, second and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of small fry enemies: one with fewer hit points and a stronger attack (usually armed with a weapon) and one with more hit points, but with a weaker attack and the ability to grab the player from behind, making him vulnerable to other enemies' attacks.\n\nWhen only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss is defeated, any remaining enemies retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down, and brings in the normal enemies once the bikers have been defeated. The third stage is a gang of women; their boss is a very large woman who cannot easily be knocked to the ground. The fourth stage features a single type of knife-wielding enemy who can kill the player with one hit. Once the player has defeated this first wave of enemies, the main character proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next cycle with an increased difficulty.\n\nIn addition to an eight-direction joystick, there are three buttons; left attack, right attack, and jump. Pressing the attack in the direction the character is facing will punch, while attacking in the opposite direction will perform a rear kick. Jumping, followed immediately by one of the attack buttons, which will perform a jumping kick in the direction of the attack.\n\nPressing the joystick twice quickly either left or right will cause the player to run, at which point attacking in the direction of the run will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and attacking in the opposite direction will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a downed enemy will make the player sit on top of the enemy, at which point attacking toward the enemy will cause the player to pummel him. The bosses can only be sat on if all normal enemies have been defeated, and unless the boss' energy level is low enough, he'll throw the player off.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Technos Japan"],"publishers":["Arc System Works","Taito","Aksys Games"],"aggregated_rating":39.0,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS","Wii","Wii U","Nintendo Entertainment System","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co471k.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":208004,"name":"Return of Serenity","summary":"A visual novel of sorts.

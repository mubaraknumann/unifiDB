They are based on the movie of the same name. Three different games were produced, each produced on two systems.\n\nThe version for the Commodore 64 and NES was a simple left-to-right scrolling platformer, in which RoboCop was required to collect/destroy at least two-thirds of the drug \"nuke\" in each level and arrest two-thirds of the suspects by running into them (in contrast to shooting them). If RoboCop does not manage to attain the required amounts of nuke or number of arrests then he has two chances in the game to prove his efficiency at a shooting range. If he succeeds, he may continue onto the next level. If he fails, or if both chances at the shooting range are already used up, he must repeat the level.\n\nThe version for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC was also a platform game, but one that offered movement in both directions (vertically and horizontally) as well as into various areas providing an element of exploration. There were also a number of puzzle sub-games that had to be completed to progress in the game.\n\nThe version for the 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST was similar in nature to the 8-bit Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions, but contained completely different levels to take advantage of the extra power offered by these computers.\n\nThere was also an arcade-only version of RoboCop 2, developed and published in 1991 by Data East (who still held the rights to create arcade games based on the franchise), which allowed up to two players at once (one controlling the original RoboCop, the other controlling a slightly purple-hued clone).

If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Arcade"],"developers":["Activision"],"publishers":["Activision","Polyvox"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":441676800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3grx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"2280","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-2280/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2085","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Robot%20Tank"}]},{"igdb_id":19018,"name":"Rooms: The Unsolvable Puzzle","summary":"Rooms: The Unsolvable Puzzle is a unique puzzle game inspired by sliding puzzles and platformer games.

On the other hand the enemy tanks aren’t so over-intelligent at avoiding your fire, so you get a better sense of achievement!

The game featured one or two robot bowlers playing with the standard bowling rules. To control the outcome, the game had five buttons: left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. \"Hooking\" the ball was the key to getting a good score, as you could only hook the ball after it had been thrown. This made it easy to pick up a spare, but the game made up for it by making splits very common.\n\nRobot Bowl was available in two different dedicated cabinets, an upright and a cocktail, both of them used the same internal hardware.\n\nThe Robot Bowl upright was of the common 1970s 'short cabinet' design, as the machine had no marquee and was only as tall as the monitor. Some machines also had a decorative 'ball return' on the front at the very bottom of the cabinet. There is an interesting story behind that. At the time the game was created, Exidy had just purchased Fun Games and had a number of cabinets left over from one of Fun's driving games. They used these cabinets to get Robot Bowl into production quickly. The only problem was that the cabinets had a hole in the front where the gas pedal had been. Michael Cooper-Hart suggested that they silk-screen the words 'Ball Return' over the hole.\n\nThe Robot Bowl cocktail was a square box with a perfectly round top. The player controls were on either side of the monitor (and you actually had to look at the game sideways to play).

The player can freely move about the apartment, and the game mostly consists of voiced dialogue sequences where the player interacts with Ryōko and can respond to her via multiple-choice answers. Unlike many such games, the two weeks of the in-game story progress in real time using the Saturn's internal clock (or the PocketStation in the PlayStation version), and the time and frequency of the player's visits will affect the events that occur and the protagonist's relationship with Ryōko, leading to several different endings.\n\nIn Roommate Ryoko you have three years to develop a relationship with her. Using a truly innovative real-time feature, the Saturn's internal clock affects how the game plays out. If you play during the day, she isn't around at times. Most of your \"interfacing\" with her occurs at night (welcome to the next level, indeed). Bad Three's Company allusions aside, there is a good bit of social interaction that goes on - you actually get to know her and have to reveal a lot about yourself.\n\nWhat is most impressive, though, is that the conversation is never recycled - there are thousands of things that Ryoko can say. Seasonal changes affect the game, and although it isn't played in real time, you must adjust your schedule in the game to hers to catch her (this is done by leaving her notes on your shared white board). Don't get antsy and set the Playstation clock ahead though; the Playstation reads that \"skipped\" time as time you didn't spend talking to Ryoko, and by the time you get to the \"future,\" she'll have moved out.\n\nThe graphics in Roommate look pretty good - forget polygons or texture mapping though; everything here is drawn two-dimensionally with special attention to detail. The sound is also pretty sharp because Ryoko actually speaks a lot of her dialogue (while it is correspondingly displayed onscreen). Unfortunately though, the gameplay almost entirely consists of listening to your new roommate and picking an appropriate thing to say (a lot like your freshman year of college really).","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Fupac"],"publishers":["Datam Polystar"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":855878400,"platforms":["PocketStation","Sega Saturn","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coac0i.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"459177","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Roommate:%20Inoue%20Ryoko"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"45063","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-45063/"}]},{"igdb_id":62436,"name":"Room of 1000 Snakes","summary":"Room of 1000 Snakes is a Unity game that places you in a room that may contain 1000 snakes and lets the player choose their destiny.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Ben Esposito"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1388448000,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wqghlevqashsadc1uz8l.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"459038","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Room%20of%201000%20Snakes"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"44919","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-44919/"}]},{"igdb_id":62518,"name":"Rofaxan 2089 AD","summary":"Rofaxan 2089 AD is a space shooter for Xbox 360 and PC","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1381276800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rwfkbesibp54cyn67j5s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":62696,"name":"Rooster II","summary":"A sequel to the 1994 action-platformer for the Amiga.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iifzruhndsjqnm4nassm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":62722,"name":"Rooster","summary":"A 1994-1995 Amiga/PC top-down shooter.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f5sqeve7iqvymuauqcaj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":62947,"name":"Ronja Rövardotter","summary":"A point-and-click adventure game based on the popular Swedish children's book by Astrid Lindgren.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":["Liquid Media"],"publishers":["Rabén Multimedia","1C Company","Oetinger Interaktiv"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":915062400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8zhu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"43683","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-43683/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"370324","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ronja%20R%C3%B6vardotter"}]},{"igdb_id":62988,"name":"Robin Lloyd no Bouken","summary":"The Adventures of Robin Lloyd is a detective adventure game mixed with some action RPG elements, set in 1926 London, You need to get the clues by talking to various people and interact with objects.\nThe game's main character private detective Robin Lloyd, must solve countless mysterious!

The Game Gear port is much the same as the Master System conversion, but has to reduce the size of its HUD further in order to fit all important details onto the screen. This also means less of the road is visible to the player.","genres":["Racing","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Electronic Arts"],"publishers":["U.S. Gold","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["Sega Game Gear","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mub.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":281830,"name":"Road Rash","summary":null,"genres":["Racing","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Monkey Do Productions"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":794016000,"platforms":["Sega CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7t9f.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":281878,"name":"Road Runner","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Tiger Electronics"],"publishers":["Tiger Electronics","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7lcc.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2043013665","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Road%20Runner"}]},{"igdb_id":282077,"name":"Rockman X3: New Year 2021","summary":"A small hack to celebrate the Chinese New Year 2021, Year of the Ox.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":["Puresabe"],"publishers":["Puresabe"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1613088000,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7lia.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":282078,"name":"Rockman X3: New Year 2022","summary":"A small hack to celebrate the Chinese New Year 2022, Year of the Tiger.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":["Puresabe"],"publishers":["Puresabe"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1640995200,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7lic.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":282079,"name":"Rockman X: New Year 2023","summary":"A small hack to celebrate the Chinese New Year 2023, Year of the Rabbit.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":["Puresabe"],"publishers":["Puresabe"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1672531200,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7lie.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":282134,"name":"Rocket League: Game of the Year Edition","summary":"Rocket League Game of the Year Edition is a digital download-only release of Rocket League, collecting three DLC packs along with the original game.\n\nUnlike the Collector's Edition, no individually-released cars are included.\n\nIt was not made available for Xbox One, as the standard edition was updated with the GOTY Edition DLC.\n\nOn 2019-10-23 Psyonix announced the GOTY Edition would be removed from storefronts and no longer sold.","genres":["Racing","Sport","Indie"],"developers":["Psyonix"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1479772800,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7lnh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":282327,"name":"Rocket!","summary":"Build a stronger ship with each play session as you earn resources needed to upgrade your ship and apply stronger weapons.

Others seek to bring popular movies to Half-Life in order to replicate the feeling of the movie in a game. Still others evoke fear and revulsion with a dark, gloomy feel. And then you have mods that make you laugh your ass off. Rocket Crowbar is of the latter type, and one of the best out there right now. If you're looking for wacky fun, Rocket Crowbar delivers. In spades.\n\nRocket Crowbar is basically a weapons modification mod, but the new HL 1.1-compatible version has a couple of extra tricks up its sleeve. First of all, the server can enable a CTF mode on any deathmatch level. All you have to do is make sure teamplay is on and that at least two teams are listed in the server options. Best of all, you can have up to six teams for some really chaotic fun. Secondly, the mod includes the option of a little pregame poll. The person hosting the server just has to edit the appropriate text files in the mod directory and activate the poll via a console command (see below). There is also a very basic bot included, if you're really short on people to kill. All right, you say. Enough with the extra stuff; let's see the weapons!\n\nAll of the Rocket Crowbar weapons have different effects than the standard Half-Life ones. Most notable is the secondary fire on the crowbar, which fires a rocket (and thus, the name of the mod). Weapon balance is taken up a bit in Rocket Crowbar; many weapons are quite lethal. If you're the type who's used to shrugging off a few hits and only trying to dodge shots from big weapons, you're in for a rude awakening. Fortunately, the \"drunken rocket\" effect helps to offset the crowbar as a major weapon. I won't list all of the new effects here, as there is fun to be had in discovering what things do. The Glock has a secondary fire that will push you a little in the direction you're facing. This lets you boost yourself to higher places without the complete mobility provided by the usual grappling hooks, which is a nice balancer. Another example of a highly lethal but fairly balanced weapon is the \"gravity well\" hand grenade. The effect is quite spectacular, but it's easy to get hoist with your own petard when using them. The rocket launcher throws out a friendly NPC, which is actually a very powerful proximity mine. Other effects include the shotgun firing a flying scientist, snarks with eye lasers (and the ability to look through the snarks' eyes) and the tau cannon's teleport effect.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Laser"],"publishers":["Laser"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":946598400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8qcc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":307361,"name":"Robinsons: Play the Game with Tim Henman","summary":"Cross-promotional LCD game for Robinsons fruit drink and Wimbledon athlete Tim Henman","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Tiger Electronics"],"publishers":["Tiger Electronics"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8fix.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1344032141","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Robinsons:%20Play%20the%20Game%20with%20Tim%20Henman"}]},{"igdb_id":307362,"name":"Rocket Crowbar: Source","summary":"Remember the good old days with Rocket Crowbar, when you could throw a rocket from your crowbar, use gravity grenades to suck enemies (and sometimes yourself) in, and fire scientists from your shotgun?\n\nNow, it's evolved and upgraded.\n\n* Silly multiplayer action, full of stressed out situations\n* Tons of goofy weapons\n* RC2 will be making use of the new physics engine more than before\n\nCurrent features\n\nWeapons:\n\n- Rocket Crowbar.

Burroughs, who spent years of his life in Tangiers. Like him, Beckett is a junkie, hooked on a terrible drug called Moloch.\n\nThe mechanics are simple: the protagonist can use the drug for short term benefits in his rolls, but the long term consequences of its use can bring problems in the future. Beckett is a messed up anti-hero, but deep down he has a good heart, can you balance his addiction with his chances for redemption?\n\n“Roads to the Red Night” is not a dating sim, but it does have some plot relevant NSFW scenes that are completely optional. The plot is driven by political intrigue and sci fi body horror influenced by the works of artists like David Cronenberg or Ken Russell.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1752969600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coafc9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":366186,"name":"Rock Band 4: 4th Anniversary Free DLC Pack","summary":"Add 4th Anniversary Free DLC Pack to your Rock Band song library.

It was released exclusively in Europe, and was based on Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2.\n\nIn gameplay, the game isn't much different from other tennis games in the market, but it differs from games such as Virtua Tennis by having some emphasis on stamina (some players get tired faster than others, and not only run slower but also lose power to return the ball on longer matches) and by forcing the player to hit the ball as well-timed as possible - a \"nice\" ball (with a yellow visual cue near the racquet) will be much harder to return, as it will bounce away faster from the player.\n\nFeaturing 15 real players from both ATP and WTA, the game features several game modes: Roland Garros allows the player to compete in the namesake, exhibition, and spectator, where the player can just sit back and see a game played by the computer, choosing one of the many cameras available, including the classic TV presentation or from the main stand.\n\nThe beefier mode is the ProTour, where the player creates and customizes his own player, from appearance to playing style, and start a career, taking part in tournaments and completing training sessions in order to improve the player, so he or she can break into the elite. Challenge mode includes the training session mini-games of ProTour, as well as Bomb Tennis, a special mode where the court is filled with bombs, and as a player wins points, the opponent's side is flooded with even more. The goal is to detonate the bombs by pushing them into the flames, and forcing the opponent to get caught in one explosion. Also included is a complete training mode, which explains in detail the differences between shots and allows newcomers to adapt themselves to the gameplay style of this title.\n\nBy completing certain goals, the player unlocks additional items, such as clothing, music tracks, trivia cards, player information and even secret players.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"publishers":["Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1116374400,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob5p7.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"306725198","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Roland%20Garros%20Paris%202005:%20Powered%20by%20Smash%20Court%20Tennis"}]},{"igdb_id":383664,"name":"RogueDiceR","summary":"RogueDiceR is a Roguelite Dice-builder.

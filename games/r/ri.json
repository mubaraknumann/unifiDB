Control wise, the game varies from other Capcom fighting games by only having four buttons (two punches and two kicks, which is closer to the SNK game format) rather than the standard six. A player chooses a team of two characters, and fights against another two character team. The actual fights, however, are one-on-one fights, with the partner only participating by being called in when a player has enough 'vigor' for a Team Up attack, done by pressing a punch and kick button of the same pressure. The Team Ups would be some kind of double team attack by the character and partner, or (for most female characters' Team Ups) would heal the main character or give them more vigor. After the end of a round, a player (win or lose) has a choice to fight the next round with the partner from the previous round, or to keep their main character in play. The 'vigor' meter (essentially a super meter) could go up to 9 levels, with Team Ups costing two levels and super moves from a single person all costing one level of vigor. Much like the Marvel vs. Capcom games, launchers can be done that allow air combos to be performed, with all characters having universal low and high launchers.\n\nThe game also had a few defensive techniques.\n\nTardy Counters acted much like Alpha Counters from Street Fighter Alpha, allowing a player to immediately counter-attack from a blocking position. However, the restrictions on Tardy Counters are very lax; any hard normal, special or super attack can be used to Tardy counter (Alpha counters are only limited to certain special moves for each character), and Tardy Counters do not cost any extra vigor to perform (Alpha Counters required at least a level of Super Combo gauge to do).\n\nAttack Cancels allowed a player to cancel an incoming hit simply by timing their own hit with the attack, which would cancel out both attacks (though it does not nullify the remaining hits of a multi-hit move). Also, one additional level of vigor is awarded.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":879724800,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation 3","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co97h0.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"15408","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15408/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"14135","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Rival Schools: United by Fate"}]},{"igdb_id":13158,"name":"Rinse and Repeat","summary":"A locker room shower simulator.","genres":["Simulator","Indie"],"developers":["Robert Yang"],"publishers":["Robert Yang"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1442534400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4mdm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"50976","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-50976/"}]},{"igdb_id":14507,"name":"Rings of Medusa","summary":"The player acts as the son of the king, on an unknown planet.

Finally, the old king finds out that a goddess called \"Medusa\" tries to control the people from out of the underworld, in order to conquer and rule the entire world with her army from hell.\nThe player who takes the role of the prince is forced to stop Medusa's advance and to reunite the split kingdom. To reach that, he must fight against the goddess Medusa and defeat her again. As the opponent is a goddess, the player is not able to find her anywhere in the country. He can only call her when he finds 5 rings, puts them together in a temple and forces Medusa to face a fight. The basic task is therefore the search for the 5 rings. Unfortunately the king has very little energy, and so the starting conditions for his son do not look very good. First he has to earn some money to afford an army which is necessary to find the rings.

It is one of a number of game titles produced by Thorn EMI Computer Software (later known as Creative Sparks) during 1982 and 1983. A TI-99/4A version was announced but never released.\n\nRiver Rescue is similar in concept and gameplay to the 1981 Orca arcade game River Patrol.\n\nThe player guides a boat along a river, which scrolls from right to left across the screen in a top-down view. The boat must avoid colliding with various hazards in the river - these include small islands, crocodiles and logs. The aim is to rescue explorers lost in the jungle.\n\nThe boat periodically passes a pair of docks arranged across from each other on either side of the river. If the boat moves to the upper dock, and explorer will run out of the jungle onto the boat. Stopping at the lower dock causes any explorers already on the ship walk back off to safety. Because of the scrolling motion, it is not possible to land at both docks in one go, you must pick up an explorer and then continue along the river until the dock reappears.\n\nDepending on the version and level, between three and five explorers have to be rescued to complete a round.

Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner.A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.NOTE FOR LINUX USERS - Due to game engine limitations we are only able to guarantee compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS 64bit or newer.

That's right, this 2018 comedy revisits the all-time classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT or The Ninja Turtles).\n\nYou get to go on an adventure alongside Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, and Michaelangelo through 50 different missions in which you have to collect coins in order to stop the New York mutants from gaining control over the city. The game is very similar to other classic games such as Subway Surfers or Temple Run as far as the gameplay goes: your character moves horizontally through different lanes by sliding your finger across the screen. You can also jump and slide under objects by swiping up or down.\n\nEach Ninja Turtle includes its own unique attacks, which you can perform by tapping on the screen. There's even a way to customize them more by using these three elements: costumes, weapons, and skills. Earn these unlockables by advancing through the different levels, or by playing with a roulette (but it'll cost a pretty significant amount of coins). With your earnings, you can also level up your characters.\n\nRise of the TMNT: Ninja Run is an incredible videogame that combines endless runners and New York's Ninja Turtles.

This sequel to the popular TY the Tasmanian Tiger is a game on a grander scale. In addition to classic platforming elements, you'll fight Aussie bush fires from a helicopter, drive around Southern Rivers while hanging on to the back of a four-wheel drive and use the bots to defeat enemies and solve puzzles - all while trying to find a variety of different collectables. And now, only on the HD remaster, you can customize TY's looks, and best of all there are two brand NEW never before seen boomerangs.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Krome Studios"],"publishers":["Krome Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1513123200,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co55cm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"779369576","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/TY%20the%20Tasmanian%20Tiger%202:%20Bush%20Rescue%20HD"},{"category":11,"store":"android","uid":"9NM1H95GRGK7","url":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-2-bush-rescue-hd/9NM1H95GRGK7"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10002432","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002432"}]},{"igdb_id":149091,"name":"Typing Hearts","summary":"Typing hearts is a brand new dating sim in which you combine your typing skills with your ability to chat with girls.

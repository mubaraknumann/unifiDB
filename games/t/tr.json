To complete a level the truck needs to be parked in a designated spot with all wheels. It is possible to lose a wheel along the way and sometimes the parking needs to be done in a specific direction. The courses include hills, fragile bridges and even jumps.\n\nThere are different viewpoints and those bring along two difficulty levels: easy (third-person) and hard (first-person).

The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Tecmo"],"publishers":["Take-Two Interactive","Tecmo","Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":68.5,"release_date":1120089600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co51ki.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":22586,"name":"Travian: Legends","summary":"Travian is a persistent, browser-based, massively multiplayer, online real-time strategy.

It pokes fun at politicians who, instead of standing up against hate, are often far too willing to zig zag their ways to personal gains.\r\nOn a lighter note, Trump: Agent of Hate also includes some mindless humor with references to pop culture phenomena over the past two years.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the satire and dark humor, the game delivers an overarching positive message towards solidarity against the rise of hate.

Quest for the Golden Banana, like its predecessor, is essentially a collection of mini-games, most of them implementations of well-known casual genre titles. The game is divided in islands, where the main monkey character and his animal friends live. Each island acts as a hub for three mini-games. On the main screen, the player has to buy plants, furniture, toys and other things to decorate the scenery and unlock a series of key items to move to the next island. These decorations are bought with gold coins, acquired after playing one of the mini-games:\n\nCascade is a tile matching game, where the objective is to make matches of three or more of the same type by switching adjacent tiles in a grid filled with food. The food keeps falling after successful matches, to be promptly eaten at the bottom by some animal that acts as a level progress meter, crossing the screen towards a small flag. In the boss battles, the goal is to make matches as fast as possible, to throw food at the enemy before they clog all the cells in the grid;\n\nCoco Bowl is a bowling game with coconuts as the ball. The coco can be guided with the mouse while it is going through the lane. Some levels have special features, like ramps and other obstacles;\n\nStone Stacker is a simple puzzle game, where the player must stack slabs on top of each other by matching their indentations at the top and bottom, creating a tall pillar at the left side of the screen. Special items, like a hammer and a wildcard stone, help to eliminate useless slabs and make matching easier;\n\nIce Cream Parlour is a time management game, where a penguin must serve ice cream to a series of fellow penguin customers. Thought bubbles over the customers heads show pictures of the recipients and ingredients of their order, while stars below them show their satisfaction level. The player must click on several hotspots on the screen, guiding the penguin to pick up the correct recipient, give it to one of the lemur assistants ready to scoop or place one of the ingredients, and finally bring it back to the client before the patience meter runs out. An iguana acts as the trash can, swallowing badly served orders. The goal of each level is to profit a set amount of money within a time limit. A bonus game appears sometimes, where the player must move an ice cream cone at the bottom of the screen and pile up on it several balls scooped and thrown upwards by one of the lemurs;\n\nPirates! is a shooting game. The player controls a cannon placed over a precarious raft in the middle of the sea, and the objective is to shoot any enemy on the screen before it reaches and destroys the raft. The raft can be repaired between levels on a separate underwater screen, where tetrominoes wood pieces have to be placed logically on its frame. Barrels carry new ammunition types, changing the power and range of the shots. A bonus game appears occasionally, where the cannon is used to feed dolphins;\n\nFish Swap is a matching game, where the player has to swap fishes on a grid, creating large schools that escape the screen. A blowfish appears randomly on the grid, and acts as a power-up liberating several fishes at the same time;\n\nWater Words is a word creation game, similar to Bookworm and other titles. The objective is to make words by connecting adjacent letter tiles in a grid. Acceptable words have their score displayed over the submit button. A number of words are required to finish each level, displayed in a list at the right side of the screen;\n\nPuffer Popper is a marble popper game, where the player controls a crab moving sideways at the bottom of the screen, shooting bubbles at multicolored bubble strings trying to make matches of three or more of the same color to pop them. The lines twist around the screen, being pushed towards a sand castle by a blowfish.

As the game opens, the Master of Mischief, the common antagonist to the Super Seekers games, uses a weather machine to freeze the mountain in snow and ice and scatters the castle's treasures all over the mountain. The player takes on the role of the Super Seeker, whose job is to find the scattered treasures and return them to the castle's treasure chest in order to thaw out the mountain.\n\nThe mountain itself consists of three levels. The player cannot climb higher until he has gathered the supplies, like ice axes, ladders, or catapult parts, useful for scaling the mountain. To obtain these items, the players must help out the local inhabitants complete math-related tasks such as adjusting clocks to a given time, balancing scales, and counting crystals.\n\nIn order to find treasures, the player must place a specific amount of snowballs at a certain location. To find out how many snowballs are needed, the player must catch an elf carrying a scroll. If he answers the riddle correctly, he will be told how to find treasures on that particular level.\n\nOnce the player reaches the top of the castle on the highest level of the mountain, he deposits all treasures found into the castle's treasure chest and is given a prize as a reward for completing the three stages. This prize is kept on display in the player's clubhouse, showing how many times he has ascended the mountain. These prizes are usually children's toys, such as flutes or toy trains.

Dekotora may be created by workers out of their work trucks for fun, or they may be designed by hobbyists for special events. They are sometimes also referred to as Art Trucks. Truck Kyousoukyoku - Ai to Kanashimi no Rodeo: Taking inspiration from the hugely popular decotora truck games. As a truck maneuvering maniac, your goal is to race against competing truckers any which way but loose. Drive on sidewalks, search for shortcuts, discover secret roads and plunge headlong into traffic with no reservation. You are, after all, a maniac. Upon winning races, the player gets a can of aerosol to paint designs and emblems on the body of the truck. The sides, top, back, and head of the vehicle are open canvases for you to drop paint and swirl a menacing symbol or a nature panorama. Preset designs may be chosen or you can create your own doodles which help you help your truck emote.

The game combines many classic gameplay ideas in one title, delivering a large amount of variety and keeps the game experience fresh.\n\nThe eleven games are all linked to a central theme - collecting sand dollars to enable you to travel to new islands, buy toys and food for your Tamagotchi-style monkey, and unlock even more games to play.\n\nEach mini game offers the player a different gameplay experience. These are some of them:\n\nPuffer Popper\nWith help from Crab the player must defend the sand castle by destroying bubbles as they snake towards the beach.\n\nA classic and instantly playable concept, Puffer Popper requires the player to connect three bubbles of the same colour to win. Use the left and right joystick or directional pad to aim the beam, and press the action button to fire a bubble.\n\nThe game can be increased in difficulty through the addition of multiple Puffer fish and by potentially removing the players aiming beam.\n\nJungle Jump\nJungle jump is a game of timing and skill. Use the left and right buttons on the joystick or directional pad to guide the Monkey through increasingly difficult jungle levels.\n\nShell Game\nThe shell game is both a game of skill and observation coupled with a way to win more Sand Dollars. Conceptually the Shell Game is extremely simple: three shells that swap, the user must pick the shell that hides the pearl.\n\nDue to the high expense of certain shop items and the cost of purchasing new islands, the user can use the Shell Game to win the Sand Dollars required to make these large purchases.\n\nSandoku\nThe classic favorite Sudoku makes the transition to Tropix effectively, with intuitive play.\n\nCascade\nCascade is a casual concept. The game is a variation on the classic objective of connecting three of a kind. This type of game can be controlled exclusively via the joystick or directional pad with the addition of the action button to make selections.\n\nThe overall design is about linking these mini-games into a \"world\" where you buy things, look after a creature, travel around and explore. For casual gamers, Tropix is simple to play, and can be played in short bites or in long sessions.","genres":["Puzzle","Arcade"],"developers":["Robot Super Brain"],"publishers":["Robot Super Brain"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1144281600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co38zx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":92879,"name":"Tricky Kick","summary":"Flex your thumbs and tease your brain!

Travel through a universe of desolate wastes and caverns roamed by mutant creatures, escape the endless forges and labs of a world ruled by machines, and survive the dangerous sky cities of a post-human society.","genres":["Fighting","Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["Angry Mob Games"],"publishers":["Angry Mob Games"],"aggregated_rating":85.0,"release_date":1702598400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5bh3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1187216011","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Trinity%20Fusion"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1911360","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911360"},{"category":26,"store":"epic","uid":"60f602b72e22459d9e9ea66bf17b3821","url":"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/trinity-fusion-e036cf"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10004850","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004850"},{"category":11,"store":"android","uid":"9NWF05VWQCS8","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/-1-/9NWF05VWQCS8"},{"category":5,"store":"gog","uid":"2090070295","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/trinity_fusion"}]},{"igdb_id":218654,"name":"True Matrix Total Conversion","summary":"The True Matrix TC for Max Payne converts this popular game into The Matrix, complete with new weapons, characters, and music from the hit film.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1096502400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":218735,"name":"Truth Loop","summary":"Truth Loop is a short game with a scary story and bizarre moments...\n\nIt has a \"loop\" style of gameplay, you keep repeating an action while the game and the story progress.","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["616 GAMES"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1651104000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5bzu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"969963386","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Truth%20Loop"},{"category":30,"store":"itch","uid":"1505551","url":"https://616games.itch.io/truth-loop"}]},{"igdb_id":219004,"name":"Trials: Gold Pack","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5dye.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":219258,"name":"Trader of the Night","summary":"A horror-themed stock market simulator where the player must make enough money to pay their debt in time.

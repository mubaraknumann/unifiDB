On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots.

While the pedal is released, the player cannot attack. In console conversions, a button command replicates the foot pedal's functions. The player loses a life if he/she is hit by a direct bullet or obstacle whilst not taking cover, with the game ending if he/she loses all lives.\nA light gun (introduced in Point Blank) which utilized a special memory chip to synchronize areas of the screen's image as the player rotates the gun around. The light gun also features a blowback function which simulates real-life gun recoil.\nA countdown timer, recharged by clearing an area of enemies. As running down the clock causes an instant game over, the player must take risks, shooting enemies rapidly and hiding only when necessary. A time extension is rewarded when an area is passed and there are also time bonuses awarded for shooting certain enemies quickly.\nThe PlayStation port features an exclusive side-story mode, in which the player's performance, such as how quickly he can clear an area, affects the path he takes through the game, resulting in multiple possibilities.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":817776000,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1y7l.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12343,"name":"Title Match Pro Wrestling","summary":"Calling all wrestling maniacs!

The pinball can activate time machines which sends it to bonus tables in different time zones.\n\nTime Cruise is a pinball game from FACE with a sci-fi theme and multiple tables. Unlike most pinball games with extended play zones, these tables are to the left and right of the core table, and the pinball can switch between them by passing through connecting tunnels. In addition, the player can power up time machines by hitting several levers with the pinball. Entering a time machine takes the pinball to a number of different time zones, each providing a possible score boost or extra ball.","genres":["Pinball"],"developers":["Sankindo"],"publishers":["FACE"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":689558400,"platforms":["TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6xpk.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"30944","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Time%20Cruise"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"34439","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-34439/"}]},{"igdb_id":66255,"name":"Tiny Tim's Tremendous Tank","summary":"Tiny Tim and his Tremendous Tank is an awesome physics based action platform shooter that allows you to Destroy and Splatter anything that moves.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oevka9likxeag1qhqs8d.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"29924","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Tiny Tim's Tremendous Tank"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"33278","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-33278/"}]},{"igdb_id":66973,"name":"Tiger Trouble","summary":"This game is played against asymmetrical opponents where one controls three Tigers and the other controls 15 Goats.

The natives here speak Japanese, however thanks to higher powers you're able to communicate with them in English. Although, if you so wish, you can enable settings from the in-game menu that let you experience parts of the game in Japanese (or romaji). These settings can be toggled on or off at any time, so players that want to turn Tinymon into a full-fledged learning experience can enjoy toggling these settings on at their own pace, as they become more comfortable with their Japanese skills (which you'll have opportunities to learn and practice in the game). Of course, you can leave all of these settings off, and experience the full game in English. Alternatively, you can toggle all of these settings on, and experience the game in complete Japanese.\nTinymon's world setting is greatly inspired by Japanese culture, meaning you can learn about the real world Japan. Thus, Tinymon provides for a laid back experience that focuses on exploration, and education of Japan's locations, customs, culture, and language (to those that are willing). We will even teach you how to use the trains system, some things you should avoid doing in Japan, and the first things you should do after landing in the Japanese airport! (Some of them even should be done before leaving the airport).","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1767139200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8yo4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":320884,"name":"TibiaScape","summary":"2D MMORPG heavily inspired by classic tibia, with many innovations and improvements adding depth and longevity to it.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1729814400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8zeq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":321339,"name":"Tim 7: Et l'Ordinateur Fou","summary":"Tim 7: Et l'Ordinateur Fou is an edutainment game focusing on CM1 level French.\n\nThe contents of the subject are:\nKnow words better: Word families, homonyms, noun groups, difficult plurals.\n\nKnow the sentences better: Match the verb, match the past participle, split the sentence, master the active and passive.\n\nHandling verbs: The present indicative and the present imperative, the past perfect and the past perfect, the imperfect and the past simple, the future indicative and the present conditional.\n\nRead, write and describe: Distinguish the different types of text, cut out a story, make a description, write a story.\n\nYou play as Tim 7, named as such due to being kidnapped by Dr. Gaaf and being the 7th guinea pig of his experiments.

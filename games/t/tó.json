He engaged in militarism without regard for the rich and the poor. Using his position as a court official, he obstructed the lending practices of landlords, favoring the common people over the gentry. Undeterred by the will of Heaven, he attempted to divert the Yellow River, a move that would etch his name in history. Fearing this move would destroy the lifeblood of the Song Dynasty, the underworld rallied around a general, a knight-errant, an assassin, and a thief, known as the \"Four Swordsmen,\" to bring down the treacherous prime minister Wang Anshi.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Niàn Xìù Kèjī"],"publishers":["Niàn Xìù Kèjī"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coapf9.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3315770","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315770"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1738854898","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/T%C3%B3ng%20D%C4%81o%20Y%C3%ADn%20Ji%C3%A0n"}]}]

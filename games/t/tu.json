Tumbleweed Express is a tower, or travel, defense game set in the American West.\n\nThe year is 1885, the height of the Age of Steam in the United States of America. But something is not quite right in the land of destiny and the free market: Dirigibaus, a ruthless entrepreneur, has monopolized trade in the West with a fleet of airships! Dirigibles and zeppelins dot the skies as agents of an oppressive business regime.\n\nSomeone still fights for the little people, though. The venerable Tumbleweed Express Steam Engine, long-thought to be obsolete and scrapped, is set to saddle up and ride again. The Tumbleweed is about to spearhead a logistics campaign meant to compete with the Dirigibaus, bringing support to those who have been downtrodden and forgotten. Dirigibaus doesn't take kindly to competition, however, so the Tumbleweed has armed herself for war...","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["The Dirigiballers"],"publishers":["The Dirigiballers"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1464652800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5rgt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":205668,"name":"Tukiyono","summary":"Bullet-hell shooter","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["nizakashii"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1653436800,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4vx9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":139660,"name":"Tunnel of Doom","summary":"Tunnel of Doom is an action rogue-lite hybrid that mixes tower defense with melee and ranged combat gameplay.

The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.\n\nPuzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen \"steps,\" even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape.

Thankfully all this changed when former Atari 2600 programmer Anthony Henderson happened to stumble across his long lost copy of Turbo while searching his attic. According the programmer, Coleco originally wanted the game to use paddle controllers in order to better simulate a steering wheel. However reading the input from paddle controllers takes up considerably more clock cycles than reading regular joysticks, and there was not enough time to animate the road edges. After pleading with Coleco, they were allowed switch the game from using paddles to joysticks, which freed up enough time to insert the road edge movement but the game was cancelled before it was actually implemented. Other missing features include the ambulance, water puddles, and the enemy car AI (although implemented in the current prototype, it was never tweaked and finalized). The game difficulty also needed to be tweaked a little as dodging oncoming cars in this version is more a matter of luck than skill. According to the programmer there was actually one more revision of the game completed before the project was cancelled that included moving trees on the sides of the road on the curve stages. It is unknown what happened to that particular prototype. Turbo didn't get released because of a car accident. Lead programmer Michael Green was hit by a drunk driver while riding his bike and was seriously injured. Since he couldn’t work on the game while recovering in the hospital, the deadline came and went without the game being finished. As it turns out the game was already behind schedule due to the time spent by the programmers switching the control scheme from paddles to joysticks. By the time things got rolling again, the game market had started to collapse and the Coleco declined to release the game. Interestingly, many years later Atari bought up the entire Coleco VCS library of games including Turbo. While Atari only ended up re-releasing a handful of Coleco titles, Turbo was put on the master part list. It is unknown if Atari was considering finishing up Turbo, or if they simply added it to the list before knowing that it was incomplete.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mpb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":89568,"name":"TurtlePop: Journey to Freedom","summary":"TurtlePop: Journey to Freedom is a platform puzzle game that introduces Bebo, Deephi, Slimmie, Smarts, Willis and Sparky the Turtle.

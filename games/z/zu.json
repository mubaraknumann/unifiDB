The stages themselves all seem to be themed around different parts of the world: The kabuki boss on the far-left represents Japan, the chef represents China and mainland Asia, the crusader knight stands for Europe, and the superhero on the far-right stands for America. Yet even outside of the Japanese stages, there's a distinctly goofy flair about the game that emphasizes screwy cultural stereotypes from a Japanese game company. The game's actual developer, Minato Giken, also helped work on the Game Gear version of Dynamite Headdy, one of the most fantastically insane Genesis platformers ever, and that same sort of unhinged design can also be seen in ZnY. You fight talk show hosts, salarymen, pandas, matadors, clowns, rock stars, and other outlandish opponents detailed in exaggeratedly comical fashions. The graphic design is definitely ZnY's strong suit, with its colorful characters and quite detailed playfields making high use of Sega's System C-2 hardware, the same processor behind Puyo Puyo.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":760060800,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z8t35n0b7s1t8gzkpsbo.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"63146","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-63146/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"500688","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Zunzunkyou%20no%20Yabou"}]},{"igdb_id":47389,"name":"Zumba Fitness Rush","summary":"Players can learn and perfect nine different dance styles: Reggaeton, Merengue, Salsa, Cumbia, Hip hop, Mambo, Rumba, Flamenco and Calypso as well as new routines including the Axe, Indian, Latin Pop, Bellydance and Pasodoble., led by Zumba creator Beto and celebrity instructors Gina Grant and Tanya Beardsley.

This hack is a remaster of the original Escape from the Jail, made in 2016. This marks the second hack contributed in remaking a game of the Ztar Attack series, as well as the third game not made by the original creator (the first being Forest Ruins: Rebooted; the second being Ztar Attack Rebooted).\n\nFollowing the story, this game unfolds as a prequel to Ztar Attack under the brand \"Ztar Attack 0.5\". Unlike Ztar Attack Rebooted, the game uses the original level layout but key sections are condensed by quality standards -- visuals and exploration alike. Plus, newer gameplay tech and custom assets are implemented.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Aglab2","TheGael95"],"publishers":["Aglab2"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1643932800,"platforms":["Nintendo 64"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5cbc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":104423,"name":"Ztarlings","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":227162,"name":"Ztime Story","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1499990400,"platforms":["Android"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6dre.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":24455,"name":"Z-Tack","summary":"As in Imagic's Atlantis, the city is under attack, but in this case, you are the invader.

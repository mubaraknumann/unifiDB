After having a psychedelic dream one day, Zak realizes that something is wrong -- space aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system. Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.\n\nZak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm's breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.\n\nThe FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":["Lucasfilm Games","Lucasfilm Games"],"publishers":["Fujitsu Interactive","Lucasfilm Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":591667200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","Atari ST/STE","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","DOS","FM Towns","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gje.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":2264,"name":"Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure","summary":"Zack is a new pirate on a quest to become the greatest pirate ever.

Instead Makkoya created their first traditional RPG, with heavy influences from both Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger. While the graphics at times can even be confused with the former at times, the combat system leans more towards the latter. Enemies are seen on the map at all times, but when the heroes approach them, the game switches into an active turn-based combat mode. It lacks the finesse of its role model and interesting features like the combination techs, though.\n\nThe background story is rather silly: A kid wants to play a video game but get smacked in the head by his mother, so he cries himself into the video game somehow. In a world full of strange anthropomorphic characters, he is Zakato, the robotic warrior, and has to team up with two goddesses to fight an evil godess' threat to world peace. On the quest further allusions to Squaresoft games ensue, like a pseudo mode-7 world map flight mode, although the view is completely static, without the little palette animations that made the dragon ride in Secret of Mana so adorable.\n\nThe game unfortunately is heavy on grinding, especially in the beginning stages, where one has to waste a couple of hours to get into shape so one can even reach the other party members. Worst of all, the game's sequence can easily be glitched, and at one point it's almost easier to force oneself to hours of mindless grinding and end up on the wrong path than finding the right one, only noticing the mistake after suddenly people that aren't there start talking in the cutscenes.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yza.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146657,"name":"Zai Metajo","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["R-Force Software"],"publishers":["Anjin"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":851040000,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2z85.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1253295038","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Zai%20Metajo"}]},{"igdb_id":150428,"name":"Zapling Bygone","summary":"Murder bosses, collect and equip their skulls.

Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.\n\nSimilarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":596937600,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","Sharp X68000","PC-8800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co61kq.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2046039239","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Zavas"}]},{"igdb_id":232826,"name":"Zavas II: The Prophecy of Mehitae","summary":"The follow-up to Zavas is, like its predecessor, a fantasy role-playing game with Japanese anime-like aesthetics, but more Western-oriented free-form gameplay with more emphasis on character development than on a character-driven plot. Through a series of choices the player make the protagonist (always named Majon, but with different family names) to be a prince, the son of a merchant, or the son of a fisherman. In the beginning the player character undergoes a series of trials (which may include arcade-style mini-games, mathematical tasks, etc.) which determine his eventual attributes and also follow his growth until he turns sixteen and embarks on a quest to find companions and defeat an evil sorcerer in accordance with an ancient prophecy.\n\nThough the game has a traditional overworld with towns, hostile areas, and fairly simple turn-based battles, many of its gameplay features deviate from the standard Japanese template. Every NPC can be approached with different attitudes (including bribe and usage of items), and often a specific attitude is needed to further the hero's goals. Money can be earned and managed through various activities. Experience points are awarded for conversations and other actions besides combat. An important factor is the party's stamina: a certain amount of it must be reached in order to access key plot-advancing locations, and building up stamina through side quests and other actions occupies a considerable portion of the gameplay. The protagonist has a ship at his disposal from the beginning of the game, and it is possible to physically sail across the sea and access any location, provided the stamina level is high enough.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":730512000,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co61kr.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"30185312","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Zavas%20II:%20The%20Prophecy%20of%20Mehitae"}]},{"igdb_id":232827,"name":"Zatsugaku Olympic Watanabe Wataru-Hen","summary":"Zatsugaku Olympic Watanabe Wataru-Hen is a Quiz game, developed and published by Hard, which was released in Japan in 1988.","genres":["Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":599529600,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co61ks.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":233734,"name":"Zane","summary":"What is Zane ?\nZane is harmony.\nAbsolute new logic game with unique game play and visual logic.\nEveryone of 50 level has multiple beautiful solutions.\nFind the balance of your inner Zane and reach harmony.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1969269280","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Zane"}]},{"igdb_id":234595,"name":"Zac's Batting Academy","summary":"Take control of Zac as he progresses through various stages, facing an increasingly challenging array of bowling machines as he blocks, sweeps and smashes his way to victory.

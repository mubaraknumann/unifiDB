Designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, the gameplay involves the player using the attached steering wheel to maneuver a car alongside a fast vertical scrolling road. The objective is to score points by driving past other cars without colliding with them; more points are awarded for driving faster. Players must do this under a 90-second time limit, which ends the game when it runs out. The gameplay concepts were adapted from two earlier driving electro-mechanical games: Kasco's Mini Drive (1958) and Taito's Super Road 7 (1970).\n\nThe original Speed Race and Wheels had an upright arcade cabinet, while Midway's Racer introduced a sit-down cabinet. Taito released an updated version of Speed Race called Speed Race DX in 1975. Two-player versions followed with Midway's Wheels II and Taito's Speed Race Twin.\n\nThe game was a worldwide commercial success. Speed Race was a hit in Japan, establishing 100 yen per play as the standard for arcade games there, while Wheels and Wheels II sold 10,000 arcade cabinets in the United States to become the best-selling arcade game of 1975. The Speed Race DX and Wheels versions were also among the top three highest-grossing arcade games of 1976 in Japan and the United States, respectively, while Speed Race DX was Japan's highest-grossing arcade video game of 1977. The game spawned the Speed Race series of arcade racing games. The game's use of vertical scrolling was also influential on later games.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Midway Manufacturing","Taito","Leisure and Allied"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":152496000,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9r0y.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"455918171","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Wheels"}]},{"igdb_id":172318,"name":"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?","summary":"Carmen Sandiego is up to her thieving high-jinks again.

The game contains six contestant pictures to select from to represent the contestants who will be playing. As in the show, players can spin the wheel, buy a vowel, or solve the puzzle. The game consists of three rounds of word puzzles with the goal being to make the most money by the end of all of these rounds in order to be chosen to play for one of the grand prizes in the bonus round.\n\nBoth platforms feature minor graphical differences from each other. Other differences include the Genesis version of the game also has an options screen where players can select the difficulty level of the computer opponents, how fast the timer is, listen to sounds from a sound test, and select which control pad player 2 and 3 will use. The Super Nintendo version lets the player select a different puzzle category if they don't like the current one.\n\nThis is the 16-bit version of Wheel of Fortune: Featuring Vanna White that now features more puzzles, digitized photography that came from the actual set of the gameshow, and contains digitized speech clips of Vanna White.","genres":["Puzzle","Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":["Imagitec Design"],"publishers":["GameTek, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":709948800,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5p23.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1216417160","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Wheel%20of%20Fortune"}]},{"igdb_id":195005,"name":"Where are My Mittens","summary":"A lost kitty.

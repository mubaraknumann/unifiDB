The game marked Team17's return to its 2D roots.[2] The game spawned a sequel, Worms: Open Warfare 2, which is also available on Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.\n\nIn Worms: Open Warfare, the player takes control of an army of worms. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing army through reducing the health points of enemy worms using various types of weaponry while avoiding friendly fire and other obstacles. The weapons and gadgets you use in battle include grenades, homing missiles, bazookas, cluster bombs, banana bombs (a Worms staple), dynamite, air strikes, shotguns, and many more. You can also choose from a variety of settings to battle in and make your own schemes and teams.\nThe game is played in rounds with each worm starting with 100 hit points. Each team takes turns controlling one of their worms. The player is usually allocated 60 seconds per turn to move their worm around the battlefield and attack the opponent worms, though this time limit is customisable when playing non-career games. Only one attack is allowed per turn.\nIn addition to timing individual player turns, each round has a 20-minute time limit. If the round timer runs down to 0:00 before a team claims victory, every worm's HP drops to 1, creating a sudden death scenario. During the course of a round, crates containing health or weapons will occasionally drop and the water level will rise.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Team17"],"publishers":["THQ"],"aggregated_rating":60.75,"release_date":1142553600,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable","Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1xme.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":18314,"name":"Worms: Open Warfare 2","summary":"\"Worms: Open Warfare 2 features a ton of single player content, new multiplayer modes like Forts mode and Race mode and of course you can customize teams and schemes to your heart’s content.

World in Conflict contains three factions: the United States, Soviet Union, and NATO. While players may only play as US and NATO forces during the single-player campaign, all three factions can be used in multiplayer games. \n \nDuring a game, players are given a pre-determined amount of reinforcement points, with which to purchase units with varying costs. Once the player deploys the units they purchase, they must wait 20 seconds for them to be airdropped to the field. If a unit is destroyed, the points are refunded to the player in order to allow them to bring in more units. During the single-player campaign, most missions vary what units the player can recruit, while some missions will offer the opportunity to recruit free units, though these cannot be replaced if destroyed. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, such as mobile anti-air guns being most effective against enemy helicopters, and repair tanks being most effective at keeping vehicles and armor repaired. Each unit possesses a defensive ability, such as deploying smokescreens, while some units possess an offensive ability, such as marking targets for bombardment or using grenade launchers on enemy infantry. Once a unit's special ability(ies) has been spent, players must wait for them to recharge before they can be used again. \n \nIn addition to controlling units, players may also call in tactical aid by spending tactical aid points. Points are primarily earned from destroying enemy units in battle. Tactical Aids allow the player to call in anything, from airstrikes on enemy positions, the deployment of paratroopers, to launching carpet bombing raids and tactical nuclear strikes. Tactical aids can allow up to three deployments, after which the player must wait until the support has recharged. In the single-player campaign, players are restricted by what tactical aid they can use, which can change during a mission. \n \nThe game interface for World in Conflict has no framing in the game. A list of units occupies the bottom center, whereas the top right hand corner contains the expandable reinforcement procurement list. The mini map is in the bottom left hand corner, while the bottom right hand corner contains the special abilities buttons (including unit formation). Players can also use a messaging system that is designed to allow conversation between individuals regardless of whether they are on the same server or playing the same game.

The clock output goes to an RCA socket which would most likely connect to something like an oscilloscope. There are also buttons for BACK and NEXT. The NEXT button is used during the video test when prompted. The colors of the case are much closer to the NES than the SNES. Gray bottom is slightly lighter, tan top is slightly darker.

When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a \"Modoki\" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \"Namco Theater\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.\n\nAs Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \"Wonder\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.\n\nThe game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get \"embarrassed\" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco","Namco Bandai Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":541123200,"platforms":["Arcade","Wii","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3h6t.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38560,"name":"World Soccer Finals","summary":"World Soccer Finals is a Coin-Operated Arcade Video Game produced by Leland in 1990. \nThis game ranks a 1 on a scale out of 100 (100 = most often seen, 1=least common) in popularity based on census ownership records. \nOther machines made by Leland during the time period World Soccer Finals was produced include Pig Out, Ataxx, Brute Force, Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat, Dragon's Lair II, Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road, Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road Track Pak, All American Football, Viper, and Strike Zone Baseball.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":646790400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uesyikbpf4z6pmqzw0q4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38825,"name":"World Cup Golf: Hyatt Dorado Beach","summary":"World Cup Golf takes the player to Puerto Rico's own Hyatt Dorado Beach Golf Course as they can choose from a bevy of fictional golfers or create their own in 18 rounds of golf.

The game had been essentially completed, but regularly crashed, despite weeks of debugging at APh. Mattel didn't want to put any more resources into the game, but Mike, although now a Director in charge of Intellivision, Aquarius and M Network development, volunteered to debug the game himself after hours. Since the game had already been announced in several catalogs and press releases (as All-Star Major League Baseball), Mattel kept the title on the schedule and let Mike work on it, on and off as he had time, throughout 1983. \n \nMike managed to clean most of the bugs out of the game, but the cause of one occasional crash eluded him. He linked in a debugging module written by Rick Koenig (Motocross) that displayed the contents of registers and status words on screen when a game halted. Mike was still trying to trace the problem when, in January 1984, Mattel Electronics was closed. \n \nINTV Corporation ultimately released the game; it first appears in their Spring 1986 catalog.

In 2013 the game was removed from App Store.\n\nThe gameplay follows the recipe from Doom RPG as it is shown in the first person while being a turn-based role-playing game rather than a shooter and puts emphasis on the plot. Combat and movement are turn-based, allowing the player time to select their responses in combat. The player turns at 90 degree angles and moves space by space. One step or action by the player allows all other characters in the area to take one step or action themselves. The game takes advantage of its deliberately slow pace, encouraging players to take their time and check out every little corner, read the books on every bookshelf, and destroy all the furniture to see if anything is hidden within.

At the beginning of the game, players have the freedom to explore the local area by navigating town with the D-pad and adjusting the screen size using the analog stick. Engage in activities like sword attacks with the \"X\" button and interact with fellow citizens using the \"O\" button. The passage of time occurs naturally, transitioning from day to night as you wander around town.\n\nStanding idly in the middle of town allows you to observe other citizens going about their daily routines. Occasionally, someone may approach your character, initiating a conversation or challenging you to a duel in a basic ring. The player's role is crucial in reflecting the voice of the people to establish a peaceful country. Success in this endeavor can lead to membership in the council or even becoming the chairman.

Worms can be played by 1-16 players at the same time - it’s a turn based game so you`ll only need one machine - but prepare to be at odds with your loved ones, get ready to shout abuse at your best friend and be willing to exact unadulterated terror on those who plot to hurt your worms.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Team17"],"publishers":["Ocean Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820368000,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1xqo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":87603,"name":"Word Puzzle - Connect words","summary":"Word Puzzle, a new word game with magical charm.

Perfectly done.\n\n---\nLOVE THIS GAME!!! by Dezign09\n\"I would recommend this game to anyone! It's fun relaxing and challenging all at the same time.\"\n\n---\nIT'S REALLY GOOD by Turbo444\nFive months of daily play, and it’s still fun. Many puzzle games have levels that get progressively more difficult, until I get to the point where it’s just not fun anymore, and I stop playing. Wooden Block Puzzle has just one level. It is always the same... never gets harder to play. But it never gets boring, and has actually become more fun the longer I play, because the possibilities are endless, and the challenge is built-in. You can try to beat your own high score... or not. Very well-crafted by some genius developer. Thanks, Dev.\n\n---\nPERFECTLY DISTRACTING by MonsterNmyHead\nYou ever get really bored? Ever turn on some music but didn't wanna dance but stillllll you wanted to do SOMETHING? Get tired of waiting for a text back? Are you anxious? Is the party you're at super lame?? Play this game and none of those things will be a problem ever again. Highly addicting game. So simple. You're in competition with yourself. And honestly what's better?\n\n---\nWOOD PUZZLE by Houston Astros Fan\n\"Good thought for eye and hand. Moves fast enough to keep you interested. I love it!\"\n\n---\nLOTS OF FUN by Kym6erlee\n\"I just recently downloaded this game and after the first game, I was absolutely in love. It's challenging entertaining, and requires a degree of concentration but without too much stress. Very similar to Tetris but the tiles do not rotate so you need to place them as they appear and the set of three tiles will not be replaced until the three present are situated on the board. That's how you will either win or lose the game. I recommended it.\"\n\n---\nWOODEN BLOCKS by Merina\n\"Ok, I hate the friend who introduced this fun and addicting game to me yesterday. I sat and played for 90 minutes straight, telling myself \"only one more game... \"I LOVE this game. Just when I think I've outsmarted the game it comes back and shows me who's boss. It's an easy, clever game, much the old Tetris, just not as fast. If you like fitting puzzle pieces together then this is your game.\"\n\n---\nPUZZLE FUN by A oSmile for fun\n\"Brings me back so many years when first I played Tetris a fun game then a fun game now.

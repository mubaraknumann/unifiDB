The missile launchers have a finite number of missiles and can be destroyed by missiles. You earn points for shooting down missiles, nukes and airplanes, and for each city that survives each round, which can earn bonus cities which replace destroyed cities.\n\nWhen you have no cities left, the game is over. Version 2.0 added sound card support; a large number of configurable options; a display of how many missiles each launcher has remaining; branching missiles (MIRVs), and \"blossoming\" explosions, in which the destroyed missiles blow up and can destroy the other missiles, causing a chain reaction of destructions.

Some games you'll find a good weapon early, other times you'll rely on wands or potions or spells.\n\nYou don't see it much in the all-action video above, but some of the most fun is had just standing still trying to work out how to get out of a sticky situation. Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it's Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it's Magic Missile... or maybe it's a Wand of Create Monster, and it'll get even stickier!\n\nYou start with your choice from 16 character classes, each with different starting equipment, stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends very much on what interesting loot you find. Maybe you'll find a great spellbook and put all your efforts into turning your uneducated knight into a master battle mage!","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["Waz Games"],"publishers":["Waz"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1343001600,"platforms":["Linux","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3m76.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":232952,"name":"Walkabout Mini Golf: Atlantis","summary":"Plunge into a lush underwater paradise teeming with life: the lost city of Atlantis where you'll discover a serene yet challenging mini golf course like no other known to man or the gods.

When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first).

Characters in Wasteland consequently have various statistics (strength, intelligence and luck among others) that allow them to use different skills and weapons. Experience is gained through battle and through use of skills. The game would generally let players advance with a variety of tactics: to get through a locked gate, a player could use his picklock skill, his climb skill, or his strength attribute; or he could force the gate with a crowbar - or a LAW rocket.\n\nThe initial band of Desert Rangers encountered a number of NPCs as the game progressed who could be recruited into the party of up to seven. Unlike those of other computer RPGs of the time, these NPCs might temporarily refuse to give up an item or perform an action if ordered to do so. The game was also noted for its high and unforgiving difficulty level and for such combat prose as \"reduced to a thin red paste\" and \"explodes like a blood sausage\", which prompted an unofficial PG-13 sticker on the game packaging in the United States.\n\nWasteland was one of the first games featuring a persistent world, where changes to the game world were stored and kept. Returning to areas later in the game, one would find them in the state one left them in, instead of being reset to their original state, as was common for games of the time. Since hard drives were still rare in home computers in 1988, this meant the original game disk had to be copied first, as the manual instructed one to do.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Interplay Productions"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":100.0,"release_date":568080000,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","DOS","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3wgc.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"768375915","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wasteland-1-the-original-classic/id768375915?mt=12&uo=4"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"12134","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-12134/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"259130","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/259130"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"11153","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Wasteland"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"1207660163","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/wasteland_the_classic_original"}]},{"igdb_id":156776,"name":"War-Gene","summary":"Dance with death in this fast-paced, anime, souls-like using a wide array of weapons and attacks.

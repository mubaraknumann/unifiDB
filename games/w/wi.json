Players are given control of a small squad of characters (six or less) and placed on a grid-based map resembling a geographical location (a swamp, a town, a river), upon which they fight battles to progress through the game. As with most T/RPGs, positional advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and maneuvering by the inclusion of \"Formation Arts,\" which increase attack damage when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T/RPGs whose battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. \"Combination Arts\" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will increase significantly. On the other hand, the enemy gets the same advantage.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Media.Vision"],"publishers":["505 Games","XSEED Games","Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1186444800,"platforms":["PlayStation Vita","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1poj.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"19971","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Wild Arms XF"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"21961","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-21961/"}]},{"igdb_id":1729,"name":"Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise","summary":"Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise is a business simulation game in which the player chooses among several characters in the original Mega Man series and competes with other players or the computer AI in purchasing spaces of property.

Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Sir-tech Software","Sir-tech Software"],"publishers":["ASCII Corporation","Sir-tech Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":547171200,"platforms":["Sharp X1","DOS","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7wp4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":2961,"name":"Wisps: The Redeeming","summary":null,"genres":["Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Jungle Troll Entertainment"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1346371200,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vdq5rfdhnrexj7zebdti.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":3106,"name":"Wii Party U","summary":"It's time to party with Wii U Enjoy board games and mini-games on the TV, play familiar tabletop games using the Wii U GamePad Controller, or transform your living room into a game show floor.

It is a horizontally scrolling game taking place over eight levels, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours (red, blue, and green) to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, can navigate between the levels through portals. At first the wizard only has access to the first three levels, but completing levels gains access to further levels. Each level has bouncing spheres of a different colours, and shooting them releases droplets, which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the correct colours. On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, further adding to the challenge.\n\nThe wizard himself is not capable of collecting paint droplets, and is initially capable of very limited movement, bouncing up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after next touching the ground. Collecting green pearls (which appear when some sprites have been shot) gives the player tokens which can be used to \"buy\" enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower, and also a companion known as Catellite. Catellite (ostensibly the wizard's cat) is also spherical in form. It normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which also renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets; the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player. As well as droplets of colours, sometimes droplets of other colours also appear, having various effects. These include:\n\nLight blue - causes a \"filth raid\", where a wave of fast-moving enemies appear, shooting bullets at the player.\nGrey - changes Catellite into an \"Indestructacat\", making it invulnerable to enemies.\nWhite - gives an extra life.\nPurple - changes Catellite into a \"mutant cat\", causing it to disobey the player's controls.\nBlack - causes \"freaky bits\", turning most of the scenery black.","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Sensible Software"],"publishers":["Ocean Software"],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7j5v.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12268,"name":"Winter Games","summary":"Third in the series of Epyx Olympic sports games.

A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies.

Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.\n\nThe game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).\n\nThe player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.\n\nThe game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":760060800,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ien.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"21935","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-21935/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"19956","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/WildSnake"}]},{"igdb_id":38558,"name":"Wiping","summary":"Wiping is a Maze / Digging game developed by Nichibutsu for the Arcade.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Jorudan"],"publishers":["Nichibutsu"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7pl0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38826,"name":"Wicked 18","summary":"Wicked 18 is a golf game with a twist.

Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena).\n\nThe game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:\nSpeed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.\n\nSki Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).\n\nDownhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.\n\nShort Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.\n\nSkeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.\n\nSlalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.\n\nAerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a \"click-along\" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses\n\nBobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.\n\nSpeed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.\n\nSnowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.\n\nCross Country:\nThe stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Sega AM3","Data East Corporation"],"publishers":["Sega"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":883440000,"platforms":["Arcade","Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co988j.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"13059","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-13059/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"11984","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Winter%20Heat"}]},{"igdb_id":46105,"name":"Wimbledon II","summary":"You started out at the bottom, an unknown name in a field of highly talented players.

The Wizard must quickly type out the words that the Evil Spirit gives him in order to diminish the Spirit and win the round. Failure to spell words properly, or taking too long to spell results in the Evil Spirit morphing into a dragon, and singing the Wizard to a crisp. The second part of the game has the player trying to keep up with Bung the Jester. In this segment, players must type out a pre-written paragraph in order to keep pace with Bung, who is hopping along the words on a pogo stick.

Chris Crawford puts it this way:\n\n\"Wizard was spec'd as a 2K game, but just four months later, when it was ready, the marketing people had decided that everything should be 4K, so they asked me if I could expand it to 4K. To be honest, I really didn't want to work on the 2600 -- I was eager to get going on the 800. So I told them that you don't just expand a 2K game to 4K: you start from scratch and design it for 4K from the ground up. That was true, and marketing lost interest, so I got to move to the 800.\"\n\nSince Wizard was never advertised in any Atari catalogs and it was never assigned a part number, most people don't even know if its existence.\n\nWizard can best be described as a cross between Berzerk and Wizard of Wor. You control a wizard (at least I think he's a wizard), who must attempt to destroy the swirling star shaped creature. The board layout is a giant maze, which makes it hard to run from the creature and to get a clean shot off. Unfortunately the creature can move through the maze walls, but thankfully it can't shoot through them. Once you take a shot you'll notice that your wizard dims a bit, this means you are recharging, and cannot shoot. Once your wizard is done recharging he will light back up again, and you can take another shot. You don't have to worry about aiming you shots, as you will automatically shoot in the direction of the creature. This makes it easy to run away but still take shots at the creature.","genres":["Fighting","Shooter"],"developers":["Chris Crawford"],"publishers":["Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1135987200,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co38sz.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"168442412","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Wizard"}]},{"igdb_id":151985,"name":"Widget Satchel II: Return of Sprocket","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Noble Robot"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Playdate"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"542225043","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Widget%20Satchel%20II:%20Return%20of%20Sprocket"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1315501358","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Widget%20Satchel%20II:%20Return%20of%20Sprocket"}]},{"igdb_id":152184,"name":"Witchy Life Story","summary":"You have two weeks to save the harvest festival!

Wings is an air combat simulation that uses a control scheme of two joysticks. The first joystick controls your plane and the second controls access to your weapons. It was originally assumed the game would use the CBS Booster Grip controller, due to a prototype box that shows Wings packaged with the controller. Wings features a fairly sophisticated control panel (for a 2600 game), containing seven different gauges that let you keep tabs on your fuel, power, airspeed, altitude, radar, horizon, and compass. Two different versions of the prototype binary exist, one NTSC and one PAL. The NTSC version of the game is dated four months earlier than the PAL version, and is noticeably different. The NTSC version is playable, but is missing the enemy planes and has numerous bugs. The PAL version is more complete, featuring a nice Wings logo and enemy planes, but also contains a bug that causes the game to crash if you continually pull back on the joystick while taking off. In addition, some of the gauges in the PAL version are not function.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mje.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":283039,"name":"Winter Cats","summary":"Hidden Winter Cats - Find and paint 100 hidden cats in this big snowy location!

[{"igdb_id":349903,"name":"UVAO Forever","summary":"A short novel that originated from a story on the Russian imageboard IIchan. On December 29, 2007, a thread was created there where a certain Moscow anonymous user shared how they met a \"certain someone\"—specifically, a catgirl—at a McDonald's on Pushkinskaya and took her home to Kuzminki, located in the South-Eastern Administrative District of Moscow. The story, beloved by anons for its \"warm and cozy vibe,\" achieved the status of a \"classic copypasta,\" and the catgirl was nicknamed UVAO-tan, became one of the mascots, and inspired many creative works. UVAO Forever is a Christmas card-style novella that serves as a \"prequel\" to the original story.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":["Erogame Project"],"publishers":["Erogame Project"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1263600000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9zrw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":375250,"name":"UvsU: You vs. You","summary":"Outsmart your past self in a battle of cause and effect.

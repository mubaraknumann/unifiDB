It was released only in Japan and was also the only one in the series not to feature a Pac-Man game. \nThe limited edition comes in a large box designed to hold all 6 Namco Museum releases as well as a memory card. \n \nIt features 7 titles: \n \n- Dragon Saber (1990): A vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990. It is the sequel to Dragon Spirit, released 3 years earlier. \nSTORY: The human beings have repeated their own foolish history, because of their own desires. And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" \n \n- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. \n \n- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. \nYou control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. \n \n- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. \nThe player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. \n \n- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. \nThe players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. \n \n- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. \nThe player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. \n \n- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. It runs on the Namco System 86 hardware platform and was licensed for US distribution to Atari Games. Set in the 1960s, the player takes the role of a secret agent who must save his female partner from a terrorist organization. \nThe player takes control of Albatross, a member of Interpol's \"Rolling Thunder\" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York. \nAlbatross must travel through two different segments or \"stories\", each comprised of five stages, for a total of ten stages.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":880848000,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rhfo9kscsrrlnfwshas3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":37707,"name":"Naxat Open","summary":"Naxat Open is a golf simulator from Naxat Soft.

It was released in two countries: France and Japan.\n\nNapoleon is a Japanese Game Boy Advance launch title developed by Genki and published Nintendo. The game is a real-time strategy, a genre which rarely appeared on consoles at the time, let alone portable platforms. Instead of being an omnipotent being, however, Napoleon lets one play as the historical French leader himself as he rides on horseback to command his troops in battle. Contrary to what the name might imply, the game itself is not historically accurate, as its missions sometimes incorporate things such as monster summons which the player much take care of.\n\nNapoleon's gameplay simplifies a number of real-time strategy game conventions while adding some of its own unique traits. Resource gathering, for example, is not a part of the gameplay directly, although there are still limitations imposed on unit building. Troop morale is another factor which the player must take into consideration to ensure that Napoleon's lackeys are fighting optimally. Not only is this a factor in the actual battles themselves, where Napoleon can sometimes utter a war cry, but it's also a component of the game before and after battles, as the lower-ranked commanders Napoleon also brings into battle with him must be monitored for sufficient morale.\n\nAdditionally, Napoleon can only command his troops by going to each one individually, with the exception of the units which are grouped with another commander. In that case, simply telling the commander what to do is enough to get all of his attached units moving. He can also heal some units and also be healed by sub-commanders as well. Perhaps most importantly of all, though, is the fact that Napoleon's mobility is limited to how fast his horse can travel; any major parts of the battle he needs to attend to must be commuted to manually, instead of more instantaneous methods employed by most other real-time strategy games.\n\nThe title is romanized as \"Napoleon\" in Super Smash Bros.

Similar to gaining new specials in crisis mode as of the first Revolution game and beforehand Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 3, the Senzai Ninriki is a special crisis mode that provides certain effects depending on the character, for example Naruto and Temari's backward strong attacks no longer use up chakra, Hinata can chakra cancel her attacks with no chakra cost, Kakashi deals damage through guard with all his attacks, Neji and Gaara automatically deflect projectiles while standing still, certain characters' moves become unblockable and so on. Most of the characters' Senzai Ninriki effects change in Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 onwards.\nOne of the game's new modes is the \"Hurricane Clash Mode\", which is also reworked into the new story mode which is original from the main storyline. In this mode, the player controls their character in a full 3D movement perspective and can take on hordes of ninja in a beat em' up genre fashion, with many character movesets retweaked solely for this mode.

The player's ship must also be maneuvered through small holes in a series of walls where fuel cells can be picked up to restore the ship's constantly decreasing fuel supply. If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny. \n \nEach level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear. \n \nEach level of game play consists of two phases: \n \n1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. \n \n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. \n \nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":412905600,"platforms":["Vectrex"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":36809,"name":"Narbacular Drop","summary":"Narbacular Drop is an environmental puzzle video game developed by Nuclear Monkey Software.

The player controls a pair of interconnected portals that can be placed on any non-metallic surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve Corporation, took interest in the team's work and employed the whole staff at Valve.

It is the first in a series of four Nazoler games.\n\nNazoler Land Soukan-gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off.\n\nNazoler Land Soukan-gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are:\n\nRotation Maze\nA maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze.\n\nNazoler Fortune-Telling\nDespite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star).\n\nSuper Jigsaw\nIn this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge.\n\nSave Princess Momoko!\nPromoted as the \"major feature\", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error.\n\nJapan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz\nA quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it.\n\nFamicom Reaction Test\nIn this simple \"game\", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel.\n\nExtrusion Puzzle\nSimilar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once.\n\n3D Maze\nA simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance. The goal is to simply find the way out.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":539568000,"platforms":["Family Computer Disk System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sbfmcq4n0rie86fd33n4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":192800,"name":"Natalia","summary":"Natalia lived a free-spirited life while running a shop for everything.

It contains six minigames, rather than its predecessor's eight. A notable feature of this compilation is that all the minigames are represented as Famicom disks on the select screen, and once a game is chosen an animation shows the disk being loaded in the Famicom Disk System.\n\nThe minigames include:\n\nPatalick\nA panel-switching puzzle game that shares some similarities with Q*Bert (specifically, switching panel colors and the isometric perspective) but is far more cerebral and less active in nature. The goal is to use the shape-shifting protagonist (who transforms from an angel to a devil form) to switch all the panels on the screen to the same color, keeping in mind that every panel in a horizontal and vertical line will flip over.\n\nGeographic Nazoler Quiz\nLike the transportation quiz from the first Nazoler Land, this is a quiz game with a geographical theme. Rather than crossing over Japan in various types of transport, the goal is to travel the world and answer questions on different countries. Answering enough questions correctly allows the player to buy a ticket to the next location and progress forward.\n\nStraw Pistil\nA gambling game in which the player barters against AI opponents for money. The opponents are unpredictable, so the game is largely based on luck.\n\nBlast Tomo\nAs with \"Save Princess Momoko\" from Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or the Cheetahmen from Action 52), Blast Tomo is the \"major feature\" of the compilation. The goal is to help a schoolgirl, Tomo, reach the bottom of a stage with the strategic placing of a finite number of bombs to destroy blocks in the way. The player must also not any let mice touch Tomo on the way down.\n\nNazoler Boys' Detective Club\nA parody of Famicom Tantei Club, the player is the leader of a detective club currently investigating a mansion supposedly hiding incriminating evidence. Should the player make too many wrong decisions while exploring, the rest of the group will stop listening to them.\n\nNazoler BOX\nNot so much a game as a more overtly magazine section where an animated character (Tomo, from Blast Tomo) reads mail from players of the previous game as well as discuss promotional features of the Nazoler Land series. There's also a section where players can draw their own images, as part of a contest for Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":["SUNSOFT"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":550454400,"platforms":["Family Computer Disk System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xsjuagzddyy2i0gepx5l.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":203380,"name":"Narrow Path","summary":"A short reflection on eventuality.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["Caeth"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1644105600,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4thb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":285100,"name":"Naraka: Bladepoint - Gossamer Iris Pack","summary":"Valda Cui Legendary Outfit [Justice·Gossamer Iris], Valda Cui Legendary Hairstyle [Justice·Raptor]","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1703030400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":231254,"name":"NASCAR Rivals: Throwback Pack","summary":"The NASCAR Rivals Throwback Pack includes 30 alternate schemes from the 2022 NASCAR Cup Series season, mostly featuring the throwback schemes used in the Goodyear 400 at Darlington Raceway.

This conflict, spurred on by colonial ambitions and the infamous destruction of the USS Maine, was decided at sea in two short and brutally decisive engagements at Manila Bay and Santiago de Cuba. With no ability to support their troops abroad, Spain admitted defeat within just five months.\n\nThe war took place during a period of unprecedented changes in naval technology and doctrine, with stark differences from one ship to the next. Both sides suffered from a variety of unforeseen challenges, be it from lack of experience or preparedness. In the end, the numerical, qualitative and home-field advantages carried the day for the United States.\n\nBut what if events had turned out differently? In addition to the two historical and rather one-sided battles, this game also depicts many hypothetical situations in which commanders made different decisions at key moments or had more resources to work with. Spanish soldiers fought gallantly even with their serious handicaps.

Two to four human players compete in a board game in which players progress by answering trivia questions.\n\nTomo Bakuso\nThe second minigame starring the schoolgirl Tomo, after Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Blast Tomo.

The player must use the items in the room they are trapped in by clicking on items strewn around it and discover the exit. As the player interacts with the room it visibly changes.\n\nBingo\nNot so much a game but a Bingo simulator. Two to four players can generate a unique bingo card and the game will randomly select numbers. The first player to finish their card wins the game.\n\nNazoler BOX\nAs with Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Nazoler BOX, this isn't so much a minigame as a response to letters sent to SunSoft about the Nazoler Land series. Tomo, from Tomo Bakuso, answers user mail.

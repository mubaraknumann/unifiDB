While \"My Fairy Pony\" was specifically designed with small children in mind, everyone can enjoy exploring the magical beauty found throughout Fairy Pony Forest. Be the stylist that every pony dreams of! \n \nAll ponies keep their states saved after leaving the app, so there's no need to start again from scratch if you have them dressed up exactly how you want them. All the ponies animate, talk, and even the dress up items you choose for them animate right along with them! \n \nAfter beautifying your ponies, you can watch them trot around the forest, or explore the forest's majestic scenery for yourself. Toddlers enjoy customizing each pony to their liking with the intuitive dress up menus. Kids also love the treasure hunt aspect of this game. All of this makes \"My Fairy Pony\" so much more than just another dressup app.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1376611200,"platforms":["iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dm2mwsevs99y8sdysaxq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":88110,"name":"My Koi","summary":"My Koi, number 1 hit on the Mac App Store (Games), is a beautiful and relaxing fish pond app. Customise and name each fish.

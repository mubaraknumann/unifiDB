Like its predecessor, it is a Street Fighter II-style versus fighter based on the original 1979 television series of the Gundam franchise, with improved graphics, a changed and larger character roster, new arenas and a more complex fighting engine.\n\nPlayers can select from 12 mobile suits: returning from the first game are the Federation's Gundam and Zeon's Zaku, Gouf, Dom and Gelgoog, the amphibious Z'Gok, as well as Char Aznable variations of Zaku, Gelgoog and Z'Gok. Sayla Mass' alternate Gundam is replaced by the Guncannon, and the game also adds Zeon's Gyan and Acguy. Each suit again features its own arena, based on locations and situations from the TV series. Many are all-new, others are just touched up from the first game. Each character also has its own ending sequence.\n\nSingle-player mode consists of 14 consecutive fights:12 against the standard suits (including a mirror match) plus 2 against secret boss enemies. The last boss suit and its pilot are not based on the TV series but were especially designed for the game. It is possible to unlock the two bosses for player selection. Two-player mode allows match-ups in all combinations: both players can select the same character.\n\nThe actual fights follow the standard best-of-three model, with the backgrounds changing slightly in each round. Controls involve the joystick and four buttons: three for light, medium and heavy attacks and one for throws (throws can also be triggered by the attack buttons). Every suit has three to four special moves (usually involving ranged weapons) triggered by input combinations, most of them requiring \"Hadouken\"-style circling movements with the joystick, then pressing an attack button.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Allumer, Ltd."],"publishers":["Banpresto"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":762566400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9qr7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":305553,"name":"Mortal Kombat Mobile","summary":"Get over here and immerse yourself in the iconic and visceral action of MORTAL KOMBAT MOBILE anytime, anywhere.

The screen displays a group of monsters doing what appear to be Jumping Jacks. At the bottom of the screen is a blue blob (which is assumed to be Cookie Monster) holding a spotlight. Pressing the # or * buttons on the Kids Controller will cause Cookie Monster to move left or right, and when you get underneath a monster the spotlight will shoot a beam and highlight the monster. Once the monster is highlighted, you can control his (its?) head, arms, or legs by pressing the the keys on the keypad. Each body part seems to have two different actions (three if you count not doing anything). The head can blink or nod up and down, the arms can either flap or pump up and down, and the legs can kick out or squat. After awhile the whole thing begins to look like a creepy exercise video, which may be where the name came from. According to the copyright message this game is part of the Children's Computer Worshop series (the Sesame Street series), but its part number CX-26131 and late copyright date 1984 are well outside the Children's Series range. Atari may have been planning some kind of series for young children and infants in order to reach as wide an audience as possible. There is evidence of this as prototypes for other children's games such as Peek-A-Boo and Honker Bonker fall into this part number range. This prototype even uses the Kid's Controller, which further supports this theory. In 1984 the videogame industry was crashing fast and Monstercise was probably scrapped due to lack of a market for such a game, or even possibly because of the gameplay was too similar to Grover's Music Maker (which was also not released). It's unknown if any more work was ever done on this title.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mr7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":267003,"name":"Moonstone Island: Delightful Little Comforts","summary":"Get the Delightful Little Comforts DLC Pack to add a little sparkle to Moonstone Island","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Studio Supersoft"],"publishers":["Raw Fury"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1695168000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co787w.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":1620,"name":"Mortal Kombat 3","summary":"Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, \"Dial-A-Combo\" attacks, a \"Run\" button to speed up the battles, and \"Vs.\" codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens.

There are three types of roads to drive on and they are motorway, b-road and dirt and you must avoid hitting the sides and drivers or you lose one of five lives.

Broken glass means you will stop and your tyre will have to be changed with only one spare tyre, and logs will damage your radiator causing your car to overheat.

Remember, there's always a screen watching you. The paycheck from your job at the ministry editing the past is barely enough to buy the food needed to keep you alive, so it is crucial that you find a way to flee this dystopia where even thinking is forbidden.\nYou can serve as a loyal citizen, fall in love and constantly fear getting caught, work with the Resistance against the dictatorship, and choose freedom or servitude.\nThe daily tasks you perform in your apartment are your only way to survive. Remember that your time is just as limited as your supplies. You'll have to choose between cooking before going to work, taking medication for your illness, or doing activities that benefit your mental state.

Each motorcycle in the game handles differently with some performing better on paved roads and others working better on rougher terrain.[1]\n\nThere are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game.

They are activated by the hand controls. \n \nThe object of the game is to tag as many monkeys as you can with your man - without getting tagged back. \n \nThe left hand control maneuvers the man at the lower left of the screen. The right hand control activates the man at the lower right of the screen. \n \nPush the joystick to the right to make your man go to the right. Push the joystick to the left to make your man go to the left. \n \nPush the joystick forward and press the action button to make your man jump up to the next highest level of monkey bars. Push the joystick forward at an angle and press the action button to make your man jump on a diagonal. The men can only jump up one level of monkey bars at a time. One man can give the other a boost. If one jumps on the head of the other, he can reach the next highest level of monkey bars on his next jump. \n \nA man tags a monkey by catching it and pressing the action button. The tagged monkey will jump away in the direction the joystick is held at the instant the action button is pressed. If you catch a monkey and delay pressing the action button, the monkey will jump away without a tag being scored. \n \nPlayers score one point for every monkey tagged. The game score appears at the lower left of the screen. The highest score in a series of games appears just above the game score. If both hand controls are being used, the men play as a team and the score displays their total points. You are not competing with another player - you are competing with the computer. \n \nWhen a monkey is tagged, it will turn red and try to tag one of the men. If a man is tagged by a red monkey, he will freeze in position and is out of the game. \n \nThe higher the game score, the longer the monkeys will stay red and the harder it will be for the men to avoid getting caught. \n \nA new game will start automatically when both men have been tagged by red monkeys. The monkey bars will be displayed in a completely different arrangement at the beginning of each new game. \n \nEvery game automatically starts at the first skill level. When ten points have been scored, the computer will automatically change to the next highest skill level to provide greater challenge. The third skill level will be presented when 30 points have been scored. The monkeys stay red longer and are more difficult to evade with every increase in skill level. \n \nIf you wish to play at the second skill level before scoring ten points, press the + key once. To play at the third skill level, press the + key twice. \n \n \nTAILSPIN! \n(1 or 2 players) \n \nPress RESET. \n \nPress 0 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nPress R (for ROTATION) on the alphabet section of the keyboard. \n \nThe monkey bars will rotate upwards to a new position every few seconds. This calls for a completely different playing strategy. You will have to anticipate the next position of the monkey bars and adjust your movement and timing accordingly. \n \nPress S (for STOP) on the alphabet section of the keyboard to stop the rotation of the monkey bars. You can start or stop the rotation of the monkey bars at any time during the game. \n \n \nSHUTEYE! \n(1 or 2 players) \n \nPress RESET. \n \nPress 0 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nPress I (for INVISIBLE) on the alphabet section of the keyboard. The monkey bars will disappear. \n \nYou are now playing blindfolded - but the monkeys are not. \n \nThe monkey bars will reappear momentarily any time one of the men is falling. They will also reappear if one of the men stands on the head of the other. \n \nPress V (for VISIBLE) to make the monkey bars reappear. \n \n \nMONKEY CHESS! \n(3 players) \n \nPress RESET. \n \nPress 0 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nYou are now playing a new kind of chess against a grand master, the Great Monkey himself. He has twice as many pieces - but you have complete control of the board. It is the classic game turned inside out. \n \nTwo of the players operate the hand controls. The third player tries to outwit the Great Monkey by changing the pattern of the chess board of monkey bars throughout the game! \n \nTo remove a vertical monkey bar: \nLocate the bar by its letter and number coordinates. \nPress the number on the numeric section of the keyboard. \nPress the letter on the alphabet section of the keyboard. \nPress CLEAR. The vertical bar will disappear. \n \nTo add a vertical monkey bar: \nLocate the coordinates for the position in which you wish to insert the monkey bar. \nPress the number. \nPress the letter. \nPress ENTER. \n \nTo delete a horizontal monkey bar: \nLocate the bar by its letter and number coordinates. \nPress the letter. \nPress the number. \nPress CLEAR. \n \nTo add a horizontal monkey bar: \nLocate the coordinates of the position in which you wish to place the horizontal monkey bar. \nPress the letter. \nPress the number. \nPress ENTER. \n \nIn summary, pressing the letter first will affect horizontal bars. Pressing the number first will affect the vertical bars. \n \nThe player controlling the keyboard masterminds the strategy it takes to beat the Great Monkey at his own game. \n \n\"Ladders\" can be built to help the men get quickly to any part of the screen. Ladders can also be \"unbuilt\" to prevent the monkeys from using them. \n \n\"Cages\" can be built to temporarily delay tagged monkeys from tagging the men. \n \nHint: Pretend that the cage has a door and memorize its coordinates. One of the men tags a monkey and uses the joystick to release him into the cage. The player using the keyboard has already preset the \"door\" coordinates and is ready to press ENTER. The completely closed cage will delay a tagged red monkey from tagging one of the men. \n \nThe player controlling the keyboard can also insert obstacle bars in the path of pursuing red monkeys. \n \n \nBANANAS! \n(For professionals only. 3 players.) \n \nPress RESET. \n \nPress 0 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nInsert the keyboard entries for Tailspin, Shuteye and Monkey Chess is various combinations.

One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!\n\n\"Monstania\" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the \"enemy turn\". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Bits Laboratory"],"publishers":["Pack-In-Video"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":843782400,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co96fk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":193577,"name":"ModBots","summary":"ModBots is a third-person arena rogue-like in which players play as robots fighting through randomized arena layouts against hordes of grunt robots and larger gladiators.

There was no more in that solar system than a large number of asteroid belts. On closer inspection it appeared that among the asteroids there flew thousands of tiny craft, automatically controlled mining vessels. It seems that previous colonists has destroyed all the planets so they could mine more efficiently.\n\nDeadalus I headed for the only lump of rock bigger than an asteroid but smaller than a planet, a moon that no longer had a planet to orbit. This moon, christened Frontier Alfa, was inhabited by a race of independent capitalist and unscrupulous robots and their creators the Remusians. The Remusians were small bug-eyed humanoids who took a much less active role in the colony than the Roboforms.\n\nThe Earth starship was soon captured by the Remusians, who enslaved the human habitants. Some of them escaped capture however, and established a small colony of their own. They set you up as a trader, with the ultimate aim of making enough profit to be able to buy the whole colony and become supreme leader, thereby being able to free the enslaved humans.","genres":[],"developers":["The Evil"],"publishers":["21st Century Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co773c.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":69197,"name":"Monster Eggs","summary":"Released on the PC and PS2 in Europe.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1177027200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cliigq8mjavs1qrh8pjd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":252197,"name":"Mobile Wars X: Ultimate Simulation Battle","summary":"Ultimate Simulation Battle is an expansion for the free game Mobile Wars X that was released as an update on Steam in 2019.\n\nThe updated changed the UI and added a 1bit game mode with 3 new characters.","genres":["Shooter","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["NAPE GAMES"],"publishers":["NAPE GAMES"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1564531200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6l9e.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":103084,"name":"Motif.","summary":"The aim of the puzzle is to create the desired motif using the pieces that are given to you.

The graphics are noticeably better, cleaner, with improved textures and far fewer aliasing troubles.\n\nThe gameplay is as polished as ever, with easy-to-learn controls, a steady learning curve, and AI that doesn’t make you want to tear your hair out... at least until you reach the later stages of the game. Moto GP 2 also offers the usual Championship and Time Trial mode of play. But, in typical Namco fashion, multiplayer mode is where the majority of the fun is to be had. In the entire history of video games, the ability to play the same game with one or more friends is still one of the most welcome features in a game.\n\nMoto GP 2 doesn’t disappoint in this regard.

It features newly hand animated cutscenes that depict events from the original television series as well as a CGI opening depicting a space battle from the One Year War and then a scene of the Gundam destroying several Zaku IIs before being attacked by Char Aznable. It is also the prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space.\n\nThe English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series' dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films.\n\nJourney to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\".\n\nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs.\n\nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Bandai"],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":999734400,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9cqh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":178525,"name":"Moonshine and I: Sansevieria","summary":"To be a human, to be a plant","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":280536,"name":"Monster is Me","summary":"Unleash your inner monster.

As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and what's not.\n\nOne of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus.

Players can use the effect of gravity to create chain reactions where one set of eliminated blocks causes another set to be eliminated, and the ability to change the tilt of the floor can be used to induce reactions by shifting falling blocks before they land.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":["DATT JAPAN"],"publishers":["DATT JAPAN"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":859507200,"platforms":["Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8e8j.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":66077,"name":"Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story II: Aoi wo Uketsugu Mono","summary":"Aoi wo Uketsugu Mono is the second game in the Blue Destiny trilogy of Gundam-based shooters.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":849830400,"platforms":["Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bw86tygtbtq7xh9ywhe2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":66078,"name":"Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: The Blue Destiny","summary":"Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: The Blue Destiny is a compilation of the Blue Destiny trilogy set during the One Year War.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator"],"developers":["Bandai"],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":872812800,"platforms":["Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4l9s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":104241,"name":"Monster Rancher Battle Card GB","summary":"A trading card RPG based on the Monster Rancher franchise.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["GRC"],"publishers":["Tecmo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":945993600,"platforms":["Game Boy Color"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5vfc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":208241,"name":"Monster Company","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":795,"name":"Motocross Madness 2","summary":"Motocross Madness 2 is one of Microsoft's most popular games and also one of the most well received.\nThis sequel to Motocross Madness was released with improved graphics, which included better textures and many landscape objects like trees, roadsigns and caravans.

Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but also each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.\n\nPlayers then train the monsters by choosing which foods to feed them with, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for learning new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased; more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling the bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however they do face an enforced retirement age.\n\nThere is a storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games are back, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended.\n\nThe two-player mode, requiring the link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against each other. It also allows players to trade items and cash money, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters bringing them into each others' game files.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator"],"developers":["Tecmo"],"publishers":["Tecmo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1007683200,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4dut.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":229615,"name":"Moémon Mega FireRed","summary":"Moémon Mega FireRed is the most advanced Moémon game.

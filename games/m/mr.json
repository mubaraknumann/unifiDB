When a Notely is ready to be rescued, he will appear in the little bucket area at the bottom of the cave. To pick up the Notely, descend to the bottom of your string. Mr. Yo-Yo will begin flashing various colors to indicate you’ve picked up a Notely. Then, return to the top of the screen to release the Notely to freedom! Mr. Yo-Yo will then return to his normal color, and you can get ready to rescue the next Notely. Sometimes, you may have to shoot some enemies to get the Notelies to appear. The further you get into a level of caves, the more timid the Notelies become. You’ll have to shoot more and more enemies for them to have enough courage to appear.\n\nThere are five different types of creatures inside the caves (Blobs, Flappers, Bouncers, Stunners, and Snippers).

So be sure to keep an eye out above you if you’re spending a lot of time at the bottom of one of the caves!\n\nYou'll find various objects in the caves that can help you out. Coins, which you can collect or shoot. Power Pods, which you can also collect or shoot, but it's better to collect them (just as with the coins).

Above ground, peace returned again.\n\nHalf a year passed, suddenly the Blocks began to overflow in three nations. One after another America, India and Egypt became flooded in blocks.\n\nSusumu Hori and his Rival Driller, Anna Hottenmeyer; urgently began to dig to the depths of the earth. Meanwhile, Susumu's father, Taizou Hori; Susumu's elder brother, Ataru Hori; Anna's Robot Assistant, Horinger Z and Susumu's roommate, Puchi, were all digging to the depths of the earth, aiming for the resolution of this disaster.\n\nWhat is the probable cause of this latest incident?\nAnd, among the 6 Drillers, who will be the one to resolve this disaster?\n\nOur hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller.\n\nIf all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his progress even further are brown \"X-blocks\" that take five drill strikes to disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller's air when broken.\n\nThis game is a Japan-only port of the original Arcade game of the same name.","genres":["Puzzle","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Namco","Bandai Namco Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":983404800,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa79q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":60728,"name":"Mr. Travel","summary":"Mr. Travel is an educational point and click adventure game by Layer cake and 3DDUO about business travel security.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ofoqrl5o2skm4twag1bn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":173904,"name":"Mr.DomusMundi","summary":"Prince Mundi solves only global issues on the scale of the kingdom.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["Dnovel"],"publishers":["Dnovel"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1638748800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5llt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":132076,"name":"Mr Anchry's Day of Twilight","summary":"Mr Anchry's Day of Twilight is the 6th installment of the popular indie horror franchise, \"Mr Anchry\".

A level is complete when all cherries are removed, all monsters are destroyed, \"EXTRA\" is spelled, or a diamond is found. \n \nMr. Do can defeat the monsters by hitting them with his bouncing \"power ball\" or by dropping large apples on them. While the power ball is bouncing toward a monster, Mr. Do is defenseless. If the ball bounces into an area where there are no monsters to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it. When the power ball hits a monster, it then reforms in Mr. Do's hands after a delay that increases with each use. \n \nMr. Do or the red monsters can push an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more monsters.

The game was intended to be a promotional tie with Wimpy restaurants as their logos, company mascots, and theme tunes were reproduced. The game was released on the Oric 1, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Commodore 64. The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.[1] \n \nGameplay[edit] \nAt the start of the game, Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries and steal these ingredients from him.[2] After the opening level, the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.[2] Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies in the guise of walking sausages, eggs, pickles, and spoons. Players have the ability to spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds, allowing players to escape.[2] Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below.[3] \n \nThe platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle).[3] As the player progresses in the game, more enemies are added.[citation needed] Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to either trap them between the falling burger ingredients or to temporarily freeze them with pepper.[citation needed] However, players can only a small supply of pepper at any given time (4 bottles could be carried).[2] Players can pick up coffee cups or ice creams that appear on the screen (when they are down to their last pepper pot), rewarding them with an extra pepper pot.[2] Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.[citation needed]","genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":298648,"name":"Mr. Woodpecker","summary":"You play as a detective investigating an empty hotel.

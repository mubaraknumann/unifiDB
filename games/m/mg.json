There was trouble with the games development as the market for video games was just starting in South Korea which lead to a lack of people with experience making games at the time.\n\nThe game was released at the end of the PlayStation's production cycle after the launch of the PlayStation 2 earlier in the year. This was reflected in it's marketing at the time which mentions how it will run just as well on the newer system.\n\nThere were plans to release the game internationally by the end of the year with the North American publisher Conspiracy Entertainment but that was eventually canceled.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Joycast Co., Ltd."],"publishers":["Joycast Co., Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1023408000,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4tqk.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"66482","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-66482/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"504027","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/MGG:%20Manic%20Game%20Girl"}]},{"igdb_id":188247,"name":"MGCM Magical Girls","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245442,"name":"MGA's Pocket LCD Games: Basketball","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Micro Games of America"],"publishers":["Micro Games of America"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245443,"name":"MGA's Pocket LCD Games: Baseball","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Micro Games of America"],"publishers":["Micro Games of America"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245444,"name":"MGA's Pocket LCD Games: All-Pro Football","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Micro Games of America"],"publishers":["Micro Games of America"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245445,"name":"MG-13: Explorers of Space","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Elektronika"],"publishers":["Elektronika"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245446,"name":"MG-09: Space Bridge","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Elektronika"],"publishers":["Elektronika"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":260382,"name":"MGP Manager","summary":"MGP Manager is a Motogp themed management simulation.

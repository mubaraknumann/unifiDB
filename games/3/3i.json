Then a logic puzzle must be solved to properly order them. Finally, in the end game, hints found in previous puzzles must be used to finish the metapuzzle and complete the game.","genres":["Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":["Cliff Johnson"],"publishers":["Cinemaware Corporation","Inline Design"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jta.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":92275,"name":"3-in-One Game Compilation","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"30985","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/3-in-One%20Game%20Compilation"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"34490","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-34490/"}]},{"igdb_id":98626,"name":"3 in 1: Solitaire, Mahjong, & Tangram","summary":"3 in 1: Solitaire, Mahjong & Tangram is a Nintendo DS game that includes 707 unique game variations.

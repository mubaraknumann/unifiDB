It is based on the TV series of the same name.\n\nThe player takes on the role of each of four family members as they visit retribution upon the very inhospitable locals in their new town. Each character infiltrates the home or workplace of a target, using a point-and-click interface to stage elaborate pranks using improvised materials found in the battle zone. Well-executed pranks can be replayed at dramatic camera angles, optimizing the humiliation of the target. Timing and stealth are crucial to set up your opponents downfall, as the player must remain out of the enemies' field of vision to avoid getting caught. All stages can be replayed at the players' leisure to achieve better times.","genres":["Point-and-click"],"developers":["Jam-Games"],"publishers":["Novyi Disk"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1173225600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ljg.jpg","external_ids":[]}]

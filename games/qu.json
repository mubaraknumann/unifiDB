It is set in the Africa-like world of Tarna, where the hero travels with paladin Rakeesh, his new Liontaur friend he has met in the previous game. Shortly after his arrival, the hero learns about the conflict between the human Simbani tribe and the seemingly malevolent neighboring Leopardmen. It is now time for our hero to become a skillful diplomat and prevent an upcoming war between the two nations.\n\nThe basic gameplay system is similar to that of the two preceding games. The game has an adventure-like structure and gameplay elements, including puzzles to solve, inventory items to use, and characters to talk to, as well as a role-playing system with combat and character development. As in the predecessors, the player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a mage; in this installment, the paladin class is selectable from the beginning of the game (unlike the previous game, where the hero could only earn the title of a paladin during the course of the story). Saved characters from the previous game can be imported.\n\nLike in the earlier Quest for Glory games, the main character's parameters increase directly after battles or by repeatedly performing various actions. New to the series is an overworld map on which the hero travels between locations. Hostile encounters may occur randomly while traversing the map. Combat system is similar to the predecessors, with real-time battles where the player selects various offensive and defensive options.\n\nGraphics engine and interface in this installment are the same as in the remake of the first game: it has 256-color graphics and an icon-based interface which was used by Sierra for their contemporary adventure games.","genres":["Point-and-click","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Sierra On-Line"],"publishers":["Sierra On-Line"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":712627200,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21g3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"7127","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Quest for Glory III: Wages of War"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"7782","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-7782/"}]},{"igdb_id":295330,"name":"Quarrel Hill","summary":"Single button - Push or slash.

Its king was recently murdered, and, according to the land's traditions, the crown will be given to the one who passes a contest known as the Rites of Rulership. The hero enters the contest, aided by Erasmus, Rakeesh, and other old friends. However, as the competition progresses, contestants are being systematically killed by an unknown assassin. All the victims are murdered near the Dragon Pillars, which keep the Dragon of Silmaria in captivity. The hero must investigate the crimes and save Silmaria from a grave danger.\n\nDragon Fire is the final game in the Quest for Glory series. Like the previous games in the series, Dragon Fire is a hybrid between puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing game. The player talks to the world's inhabitants, gathering clues and items necessary to acquire in order to complete the quests and advance the story. Unlike all its predecessors, Dragon Fire has no separate battle screens; the action-based battles take place on the exploration screen, utilizing a simple point-and-click interface, similarly to Diablo. The game has heavier weapon and armor management than other Quest for Glory games, strengthening the RPG angle.\n\nMany quests are optional or can be completed in different ways.

It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.\n\nLike the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle).\n\nCombat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.","genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Sierra On-Line"],"publishers":["Sierra On-Line"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":754704000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25ev.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"11357","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-11357/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"10425","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Quest%20for%20Glory%20IV%3A%20Shadows%20of%20Darkness"}]},{"igdb_id":215778,"name":"Queen Mary's Script Retold","summary":"Queen Mary's Script tells the peculiar story of a girl thrust into the world of dolls and contracts.

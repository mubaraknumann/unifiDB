The arsenal consists of single or dual pistols, shotguns, machine guns, shotguns and other items such as a scope, dynamite and boiler plates. Weapons can be found by picking them off dead players or through the in-game buy menu. Cash for the weapons is earned by killing players or by collecting it in the level where it respawns regularly. Through the same menu, ammunition can be bought. \n \nThe levels often offer a stealth approach, hiding behind crates or shooting through windows that can break. Weapons can only contain a small amount of bullets (unless an additional ammo belt is bought) and need to be reloaded regularly. Different body parts can be targeted for different damage and when hit players notice a small slowdown in movement. \n \nSingleplayer is also available with all the team modes, but with the same maps and game modes to be played against bots with customizable skill levels. It is also possible to play a game with a handicap to even the odds.

The plot revolves around a war between two factions of toy soldiers, the Gorgonites and the the Commando Elite. The player takes the role of Archer, the leader of the Gorgonites, who has to cross five levels while facing the Commando Elite's soldiers.\n\nThe goal is simply to find the goal without dying; in one instance within a hidden time limit. However, during the first four levels Archer is completely defenseless and has to dodge the enemies. The last level introduces two new gameplay mechanics: a bow which stuns enemies and simple switch puzzles. The levels are side-scrolling, but there are junctions.\n\nThis game is unrelated to the PlayStation and PC release of the same name.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Tiertex Design Studios"],"publishers":["THQ"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":909878400,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3rnr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":201096,"name":"Smilemo","summary":"A new side-scrolling platformer where you go flying out of control at the slightest touch!

It is the mid 1950s and the race for dominance between the US and the Soviet Union is about to move into a new dimension: space. Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game.\n\nRoad to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nThe game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition. Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure.\n\nYou will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes. The number of options available ensure every game will be different and there is huge replay value.\n\nTo verify its accuracy and authenticity, the game, is being developed in consultation with Dr. Buzz Aldrin, former U.S. Air Force combat pilot (66 missions in Korea) and NASA astronaut, who took part in the first Moon landing mission and became the second human being to walk on the Moon.\n\nIf you have any interest in space exploration and the events that transpired during the 'Race to the Moon', this is a game you just do not want to miss.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Slitherine"],"publishers":["Polar Motion"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1409875200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2pmw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":302781,"name":"Bug","summary":"Bug is an action clicker game where you just smash pesky bugs and DO YOUR PART!

Yes, yes, the same one that created and released the well-known Farm Frenzy and the Treasures of Montezuma.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. We control a green dragon (and in the game mode for two - also blue), which shoots green bubbles at enemies, and as soon as the enemies hit them, they immediately find themselves in a trap, and we calmly pop these bubbles as a dragon. And from the enemies we get their leftovers in the form of various kinds of food: from fruits to a mug of beer, which also appear as a randomly appearing bonus. There are only 8 enemies - these are clockwork toys familiar to us from the original, and weirdos in a white cloak, and brown ghosts similar to octopuses, and flying monsters with a propeller, and jumpers, and fluffy monsters, and sorcerers, and spiders. If clockwork toys, propeller monsters and octopuses are not particularly dangerous, and they can be easily killed, then here are the rest to be wary of. You should especially be wary of types in white robes and sorcerers who, when they meet you, launch fireballs at you. Sometimes there are several of them at the levels. In some levels, it happens that the monsters are in a small room of platforms, the path to which either leads to a trap or does not exist at all. Then bubbles with lightning come to the rescue, with the help of which you can instantly kill enemies. And if there is open space at the same time, then you can use bubbles with water, crushing enemies when interacting with the player, and with fire, leaving behind traps that kill enemies in the form of a fire floor.\n\nAt levels, bubbles with letters appear from time to time, with which you can make a word and teleport to an empty room without enemies, where you will receive prizes in the form of bonuses and an increase in a unit of health.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["GameOver-Games"],"publishers":["Alawar Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":946684800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6jq3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":333186,"name":"BuildNow GG","summary":"BuildNow GG is part of an emerging genre of online game that combines tactical building with third-person shooter gameplay, featuring various game modes, weapons, and cosmetic items.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Strategy","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["BattleLab"],"publishers":["BattleLab"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1629676800,"platforms":["Web browser","Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9gee.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":201355,"name":"Button Lock 2: Star Carrier","summary":"Can you solve the puzzle with the limited amount of moves?

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.\n\nThe player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.\n\nEnemies turn \"angry\" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence).\n\nAfter a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost.\n\nContact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) results in death.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":519264000,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7j5x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":358957,"name":"Burn The Witch: Toll of the Bell Bearer","summary":"Forge powerful cards and reshape your strategy in this roguelike deck-builder set in a cursed forest.

Its core gameplay is similar to the 1983 Japanese MSX game Cannon Ball, also released that year for the ZX Spectrum as Bubble Buster.\n\nPlayers embark on a round-the-world quest to destroy bouncing balloons that are threatening landmarks and cities across the globe. The game features 50 stages set in 17 locations, including Mt. Fuji, Mt. Keirin, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, Angkor Wat, Ayers Rock, the Taj Mahal, Leningrad, Paris, London, Barcelona, Athens, Egypt, Kenya, New York, Maya ruins, Antarctica, and Easter Island. Later versions added additional locations. Each stage includes a background depicting local landmarks, along with a unique arrangement of blocks, some destructible, some permanent, and some hidden with bonus items.\n\nStages begin with balloons of various sizes; the largest balloons split into smaller ones three times before disappearing after the fourth hit. Players start with a single harpoon, though special weapons can drop when balloons are popped. At certain points, food items worth bonus points may also appear.

The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level.\n\nWhile the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a \"bubble shooter\", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.\n\nBubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop.

These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.\nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\".\nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events.\nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them.\nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins).\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player.\nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Criterion Games"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":90.5,"release_date":1126569600,"platforms":["Xbox","Xbox 360","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2nhp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":260119,"name":"Butcher's Creek","summary":"Use rusty tools to brutalize a perverted gang of serial torturers in the remote Appalachian Forest.","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["David Szymanski"],"publishers":["David Szymanski"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1737590400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa1uj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":236398,"name":"Burning Secrets: A Bara Visual Novel","summary":"In one of Zafir's expeditions, the old wizard disappears and Fin decides to rescue him with Luxus's help.

With a back catalog of several installments of the then-leading world atlas and almanac software, PC Globe, the company turned snippets of country-specific info into an educational game that mixed two-player “Identify that place” strategy with a “Get to know the globe” learning effect – can you say Carmen Sandiego? \n \nAs the sinister Otto von Slinkenrat tries to pocket the world’s treasures in his private collection, renowned adventurer Bush Buck sets out to find and secure the valuable objects for posterity. In a race around the globe, you and an opponent travel back and forth between 206 cities in 175 countries in search for clues to the treasures’ whereabouts. Cities are connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background info – e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture. \n \nLearning to place countries and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features of the target country and town which help narrow down your options – e.g. “It’s an island country”, “It’s in East Asia” etc. The first player to visit the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base for a points reward. \n \nFor each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400 possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe trotters.","genres":["Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jgw0vqv3gzh3lzlwtxtp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":101039,"name":"Bug Heroes Quest","summary":"Enter Bug Heroes Quest, a spin-off of the critically acclaimed Bug Heroes, by Foursaken Media!

Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta.\n\nCompletion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.\n\nThe North American version of the original arcade release is much different than the other versions. One of the most major changes in this version is that Bub and Bob were removed from the game and replaced with a pair of disembodied hands. Also, the characters that were in the Vs. CPU mode were removed and replaced with a generic computer. The backgrounds from the original version were also removed and replaced with 15 new backgrounds, but this also means that the backgrounds get looped in the Puzzle mode, which is 30 stages long. The audio was also changed, and the voices in the game were removed, even though they were in English anyway.

The game is the sequel to Lakers versus Celtics. The game's name refers to the previous season's NBA championship series, the 1991 NBA Finals matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.\n\nAlthough there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.\n\nBulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, \"EASN\", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.\n\nGameplay[edit]\nThe game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Playoffs\". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters. New to the series is a star underneath the player to let users easily know which player they are controlling.\n\nReception\nReview scores\nPublication Score\nMegaTech 80%[1]\nMegaTech said that the game had impressive graphics and atmosphere, but that it did not play as fast as David Robinson's Supreme Court.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Electronic Arts"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662688000,"platforms":["Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5k32.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":196263,"name":"Bunker 2322","summary":"A visual novel in a post-apocalyptic setting.

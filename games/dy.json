It may end up being integral to your group’s survival, or it may lead you down a path to murder and cannibalism.\n\nStories in Dyscourse are emergent, and choices made in the game directly tie to the survival or downfall of the group. As players get to know their fellow castaways and make critical and interpersonal decisions, drama dynamically unfolds, and your choices author your own unique story.\n\nWe've designed Dyscourse so that players will end up with vastly different stories forged from their choices - everyone’s playthrough will have a unique story to tell.

The player mans the advanced attack chopper Dyter-07 to drive them back and rescue scientists on the way. The game has eight levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. For each of the four tropical islands, the surface has to be cleared at first by flying around in a side-scrolling perspective, reminiscent of Choplifter. Alien opposition can be destroyed by shooting them, but after six hits the helicopter gets destroyed. \n \nThe basic goal is to destroy a number of robots which are found by using the radar. However, the chopper is not able to destroy those; that's why it carries the Battledroid, a tank. When the chopper lands, the tank is detached and can be driven over the surface of the island. A side effect of destroying the robots is the rescue of human scientists which are held hostage in said robots. They can be picked up with the helicopter and brought to the base. While this is not required to finish the level, rescued scientists net vital upgrades like better weapons, a better shield or the ability to move underwater. All those upgrades can be either applied to the chopper or the tank. \n \nAfter all robots are destroyed, a volcano opens up and the player moves right in. In the following section the game transforms into a vertically scrolling shooter.

Four \"armies\" in two different colors are at the center. \n \nA flashing question mark at the right hand side of the screen is asking if the \"armies\" of that color are to be played by a person or the computer. \n \nPress \"yes\" on the alpha-numeric keyboard for person. Press \"no\" for computer. \n \nIf you have entered \"yes,\" a second symbol will appear followed by a flashing question mark. If you wish that color played by a person, press \"yes.\" If you want to play against the computer, press \"no.\" \n \nIf you have elected to play against the computer, the symbol for microprocessor will appear on the screen. \n \nIf you are playing against another person, individual timers will appear separately at the top of the screen. Player one's timer will appear first. \n \nYou can enter up to 99 minutes of time for each player in the game. Different times may be entered for each player to give a novice more of a chance against an experienced player. If you want to play with no time limit, enter 00 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nIf you are playing against the computer, the microprocessor will make its move instantly. It can make more than 100,000 electronic decisions per second. \n \nThe object of the game is to occupy as much of the matrix as possible. \n \nThe game begins with two \"armies\" of each color at the center of the matrix. \n \nThe game ends when the board is filled or when neither player can enter a move and capture and opposing \"army.\" The player with the most \"armies\" on the matrix is the winner. A running score appears at the top of the screen throughout the game. \n \nEvery entry must satisfy two conditions: \n- An \"army\" must always be placed next to an opponents \"army.\" \n- One or more of the opposing \"armies\" must be trapped by the newly entered \"army\" and another \"army\" of the same color. The trapped \"armies\" will automatically change to the conqueror's color. \n \nIf these condition cannot be met, there will be an audio signal and the player loses a turn. \n \nUse the joy stick of the hand control to position the box on the screen where you want to locate an \"army.\" Press the action button to enter the \"army\" onto the screen. Player one uses the left hand control. Player two uses the right hand control. \n \nPlayers may capture more than one army in different directions on the same move. The directions may be in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal straight line. \n \nSecret strategy hints. \n- The corners are the most important strategic positions. Once an \"army\" occupies a corner, it controls three directions. An \"army\" commanding a corner position cannot be captured because it cannot be surrounded on two sides in a straight line. \n- The outside positions of the matrix are very important because they effect five directions but are only vulnerable from two sides. \n- Caution! Be careful before occupying the first rows inside the perimeter of the matrix. They are jumping off points to the outside and corner positions. \n \n \nVERSION II: DIRECTIONAL DYNASTY \n \nPress 1 on the alpha-numeric keyboard if you are playing on color TV. \n \nPress 3 on the alpha-numeric keyboard if you are playing on Black and White TV. \n \nEnter player information and timer settings as per Dynasty rules 4 through 9. \n \nDirectional Dynasty differs from Dynasty in only one way, but it changes the game completely. Players cannot capture \"armies\" in more than one direction on the same move. You must make a choice. \n \nWhen you enter an \"army\" into a position offering an option to capture \"armies\" in more than one direction, the surrounded \"armies\" will not change color automatically. \n \nPush the joy stick on the hand control towards the \"army\" or \"armies\" you wish to capture. A second positioning box will appear in that row. \n \nPress the action button and the surrounded \"armies\" in that row will change color automatically. \n \nIt is very important to consider strategic position as well as the number of \"armies\" open to capture when exercising a directional option.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Magnavox"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":286675200,"platforms":["Odyssey","Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23de.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":39651,"name":"Dynamite Duke","summary":"Dynamite Duke is a 1989 action arcade game developed by Seibu Kaihatsu.

This installment still features the same storyline based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, with the various officers as playable characters. The character list and appearance is the same as in Dynasty Warriors 6, meaning some of the previous game's characters are not available.\n\nThe difference in this one is that the player is allowed to choose only one character for the chosen force (either Wei, Wu or Shu) who starts in a village that will act as the hub, or camp, from which the game battles are accessed. By completing story missions, some characters are added and can be played as without starting a new game, meaning all acquired weapons, items and materials will be kept.\n\nThe chosen character can be customized in various ways. Apart from the main weapon, one sub weapon, chosen from many weapon types, can be equipped. Both weapons can be switched anytime during battle, to accommodate the situation. A new addition is the Chi system which allows to set special abilities to the character, there are four slots to equip Chi (the two arms and legs). Weapons can also be customized by adding Orbs that give different abilities, such as elemental properties.\n\nIn the village, the player can exchange materials, buy weaponry, items for use in battle, Chi skills and Orbs. Some NPC's may appear in the village, some giving materials or items, or Officer cards, which can be set to help the Village's growth. Over time, better items can be acquired from the shops.\n\nBy talking to the quest board or the Guard at the village's gate, main Missions or Requests can be chosen. Each battle is a series of small maps where various enemy soldiers and weaponry are fought, eventually leading to the commander of the enemy army. The goal of each battle can vary, some are classic goals like \"Defeat the Commander\" and some, less battle oriented, like \"Retrieve all treasure boxes\". In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion.\n\nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage.\n\nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them. Multiplayer mode is available only via AdHoc connection, and can connect up to four players.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Omega Force"],"publishers":["Koei","Koei Tecmo"],"aggregated_rating":58.33333333333334,"release_date":1235606400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation Portable","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co60k0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":300632,"name":"Dynamite Duchess 3: Carnival of Souls","summary":"Explore Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory (and invade a few of your friends' heavenly suites) on a quest to save your mother's soul.

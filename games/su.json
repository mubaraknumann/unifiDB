It was released by the biblical video game producer Wisdom Tree in 1994, and was the only commercially released SNES game in the U.S. that was not officially sanctioned by Nintendo. In order to bypass the Super Nintendo's lockout chip, Wisdom Tree devised a pass-through system similar to the Game Genie, where the player had to insert an officially licensed SNES game into the cartridge slot on top of the Super 3D Noah's Ark cartridge. Despite its name, it is unrelated to Konami's official Noah's Ark game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In January 2014, the game was re-released for the SNES, initially available only by private email orders, but later through Piko Interactive's website. The game was also updated for the 20th Anniversary Edition and released at itch.io on May 26, 2014 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\nThe game plays similarly to Wolfenstein 3D, but the graphics were changed to reflect a non-violent theme. Instead of killing Nazi soldiers in a castle, the player takes the part of Noah, wandering the Ark, using a slingshot to shoot sleep-inducing food at angry attacking animals, mostly goats, in order to render them unconscious. The animals behave differently: goats, the most common enemy, will only kick Noah, while the other animals such as sheep, ostriches, antelopes and oxen will shoot spittle at him from a distance. Goats are also unable to open doors, which the other animals can do.\nThe gameplay is aimed at younger children. Noah's Ark includes secret passages, food, weapons and extra lives. There are secret levels, and shortcut levels as well. The player eventually comes across larger and more powerful slingshots, and flings coconuts and watermelon at the larger boss-like animals, such as Ernie the Elephant and Carl the Camel.","genres":["Shooter","Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":["Wisdom Tree"],"publishers":["Piko Interactive","Wisdom Tree"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":788832000,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Linux","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co258d.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":42324,"name":"Supapoon","summary":"A cutesy Breakout clone developed exclusively for the Japanese Super Famicom.\n\nSupapoon is a Super Famicom game released late in 1995 that presents a colorful world with an elastic blue hero reminiscent of a Dragon Quest slime. The hero's solar system has been invaded by a group of yellow balls wearing triangular shades, and he jumps into action to send them packing.\n\nSupapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid, but offers a few twists of its own, like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the \"paddle\"'s intrinsic elasticity, and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks.\n\nThe goal of the game is to reflect a ball of energy around a table, ensuring that it doesn't fall off the bottom of the screen. Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen, which is common for other games of this type, the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen, however.\n\nOccasionally, items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle, adding more balls, extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars, the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle, causing more damage to blocks. If the player finds four stars, this charged up bounce will clear the screen.\n\nSkulls can often drop from blocks too, and collecting these will lower a green gauge at the side of the screen, which operates as a combined timer/health bar.","genres":[],"developers":["NOW Production"],"publishers":["Yutaka"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":812937600,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co307w.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":195302,"name":"Sumy Shelltris: Iceblocks 3","summary":"Tetris?

Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the passage that he wishes to unlock. As usual, ghosts will keep chasing Pac around the maze until he has lost all his lives. However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the ghosts quickly.\n\nThere are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only last for a number of seconds. During the time that he is enlarged, a flashing star will appear besides two boxes that are located in the middle of the maze. The first box will display the current fruit or prize, and the other will display a rotating selection of them. If Pac manages to eat the star when they match there will be a large bonus score.\n\nOccasionally, after three or more stages, there will be a bonus stage where Pac automatically gets enlarged. The object of these stages is to eat everything in the maze before the time runs out and, during these stages, there will be no ghosts to pursue him.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"developers":["Beam Software","Namco"],"publishers":["Bally Midway","Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":401846400,"platforms":["Arcade","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Atari 5200","DOS","Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ta6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":284639,"name":"Surveillance Work","summary":"Surveillance Work is a horror spot-the-difference game where you monitor surveillance camera footage to discover and report anomalies.","genres":["Point-and-click","Indie"],"developers":["Maki Toguro"],"publishers":["Maki Toguro"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1706832000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7plw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":369687,"name":"Supreme Heroes","summary":"Highschool sophomore Jacob suddenly discovers he has super powers and must team up with his best friends to become the 'Elect Few', but convincing them to embrace their powers and save the world is all but easy.

The game is an interesting and unique crossover between the 'puzzly' side of Tetris and the 'save all the rodents' side of Lemmings. The goal of the game is to guide a bald and fun looking creature, who also happens to be a treasure hunter called Gussun (and his friend Oyoyo in two players mode), to the level's exit. This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long. Additionally, traps and monsters soon appear and things get quickly tricky and will squeeze the juice out of the player's brain in no time.

The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius' inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius' societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.\n\nThe Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.\n\nThe game is set in the inner half of the solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius.\n\nThe red/green/blue powerups from the first game return, and have the same function: respectively, upgrades to the \"missile\" main weapon and \"bomb\" subweapon, and a shield to absorb some damage. Two new power-ups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new \"laser\" main weapon that functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to all the players weapons.\n\nActually acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is completely different from Darius: a formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a given formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Further, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade the same as before.\n\nAnother new feature in Darius II is the appearance of minibosses known as \"captains\"; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss. In Darius II, these are all smaller versions of bosses from the first game, with similar abilities.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["NEC Avenue","Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":756691200,"platforms":["Wii","Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xx5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":276286,"name":"Suv 4x4 Car Parking Simulator","summary":"Perform realistic parking tasks with SUV vehicle, win prizes, customize your vehicle, and experience the excitement!

You must avoid and bomb the other flying machines and you complete the level when the timer reaches zero. The second level sees you with the ability to fly as yourself but with limited fuel which is viewed from the side but the game scrolls left or right when you move. You must avoid balloons and planes while you can collect any car or cat on the ground. There are fuel depots which will increase your fuel meter.\n\nThe third level has you driving on a vertical scrolling road viewed from above as you must avoid the other car on the road and touching the sides. You can speed up or slow down. The fourth level is a platform game with the whole level shown on the screen. You must get to the top by jumping from various platforms while avoiding the bombs from a helicopter. Hitting a platform at the wrong angle also kills you and the tide slowly rises at the bottom.\n\nOnce you have completed the four levels you then repeat them again. You have five lives and once they have gone it is game over. The joystick is used to control your hero with just one player playing the game.\n\nThe C16 version has just three levels and misses out the second level where Super Gran flies.","genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Tynesoft Computer Software"],"publishers":["Tynesoft Computer Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Commodore 16","Amstrad CPC","Commodore Plus/4"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co86rh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":9151,"name":"Super Punch-Out!!","summary":"Slug your way through the grueling and sweat-pounding matches of the Minor, Major and World Circuits.

The green one is the Silver Hawk of Darius. The blue one is the Silver Hawk of Darius II. The red one is a new prototype of Silver Hawk that exists only in this game.\n\nThere are three power-ups in this game, which can be obtained in three ways:\n- Destroying a complete formation of ships like in Darius II and Darius Twin or amoebas.\n- Destroying a flashing meteor during a meteor rain.\n- Destroying a futuristic cage on the floor and/or ceiling of an area.\n\nThe power-ups for this game are the red bubble (shot and bomb power up), the blue bubble (shield regenerate and level up), and the green bubble (randomly gives a bonus point or an extra ship). There is also a special power up that can destroy all enemies on screen if it's destroyed (like Darius II) or can make the Silver Hawk shoot a powerful laser beam if its grabbed by the player.\n\nThere is no power up bar, which means that if a Silver Hawk is destroyed, the shots and bombs are powered down to the minimum level. Also, when the player loses a ship on a stage, it is returned to the 'check point' (not identify in game) of that stage, if the ship has lost during a boss also return the last 'check point' before the boss appear.\n\nLike Darius Twin, the player uses (by default) the Y button for shot and the B button for dropping bombs. As long as the player keeps pressed both buttons, the shots are powered down one level. The player can switch between bombs and side laser guns by pressing the R button.\n\nThe stages map for this game is very different of the rest of the Darius games. This map contains 15 stages, but only allows the player to take the forward or up paths, until the player reaches the L, N or O stage. Each one of those three stages contains its own boss and ending.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":748828800,"platforms":["Satellaview","Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co91pn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":364787,"name":"Survivors Dawn: Zombie World","summary":"A tactical zombie survival shooter where you lead a squad, scavenge for supplies, and fight to outlast the undead.","genres":["Strategy","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1756425600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coadss.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":339866,"name":"Super Mario World Remastered","summary":null,"genres":["Platform"],"developers":["JHDev2006"],"publishers":["JHDev2006"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1740441600,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9o8t.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":318002,"name":"Sultan's Game","summary":"Sultan's Game is a card-based simulation and narrative game, inspired by The One Thousand and One Nights.

What remains of humanity resides deep within caverns, searching for gold, a substance still considered valuable. With enough gold, a person can buy safe passage from the planet. Chief among these Lode Runners is Jake Peril, a man who spends most of his time climbing ladders and ropes, walking across platforms, falling off platforms, digging holes and, of course, scooping up piles of gold.\n\nAs you guide Jake around the underworld, grabbing all the gold so you can progress to the next level, a subterranean cult of gold worshippers will follow you around and make your task difficult. You can dig holes to momentarily trap these Mad Monks, but you should be careful not to trap yourself or touch a monk. As you go from level to level, the gold will be harder and harder to gather as you are basically forced to figure out puzzles that will enable you to dig your way to, fall on, or otherwise come in contact with the gold.\n\nLode Runner Extra is similar to The Legend Returns, but with the addition of bombs, goo, teleporters and other tools for use in outwitting the Mad Monks and rival Lode Runners. In this game, the monks have abducted Jake (right after he found enough gold to escape the planet) and banished him to their deepest, deadliest caverns.

Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint. This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks. Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control. To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air. He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth. As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity. What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too. This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you. If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn). Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["AI"],"publishers":["St. GIGA","Hudson Soft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":809568000,"platforms":["Satellaview","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co305c.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":334283,"name":"Super Multitasking Go!","summary":"Super Multitasking GO! trains, then challenges players to play up to 4 continuously-shuffling minigames at once, using a single controller (or keyboard) and a unique control scheme.\nA special free version of Super Duper Multitasking, Super Multitasking GO! contains that game's core game modes--Quickplay and Mission--and features a subset of its minigames.","genres":["Puzzle","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["yyrGames"],"publishers":["yyrGames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1741651200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ht4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":367057,"name":"SuccuBoss","summary":"Conquer your succubus boss with a battle of words!\nA workplace comedy with a limited-time turn-based strategy battle.

You’re probably here because you’re looking for a fun hack of Super Mario Bros, right? If so, Super Mario Bros HF could be just for you. Perhaps the main focus of SMBHF is the difficulty. Most hacks that redo levels (at least the ones that I’ve tried) make the game nearly impossible! I’ve had quite a few games where I couldn’t get past the first few levels without savestates. In my opinion, games like these are just not fun. How can you enjoy a game if you have to keep saving after each major jump? I don’t think you can.\n\nThat is why SMBHF’s levels are about as difficult as the original game’s. You will NOT find ultra-hard levels in SMBHF; if you can beat Super Mario Bros, you can beat SMBHF. These levels were created for the gamer’s enjoyment, not for the gamer’s frustration. Each level (1-1 through 8-4) has been changed. Some have been changed moreso than others, but each has been significantly altered.\n\nThe lesser focus of SMBHF is graphic changing. Some major graphic changes include: New floor tile, New underwater tile, New “?” blocks, New brick graphics (Borrowed from SMB2J), and others. There are also some minor graphic changes that you may notice throughout the game. (And yes, those lines on Mario’s face are longer sideburns.)","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1142208000,"platforms":["Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9v05.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":336738,"name":"Sunken Engine","summary":"Sunken Engine is a Lovecraftian Ship Repair Simulator.

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.\n\nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\n\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":588902400,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ahfjuff8s6xnvchb2gfc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":333395,"name":"Supernatural Squad","summary":"Dive into a spine-tingling and exhilarating multiplayer adventure rooted in Chinese horror folklore.

Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line \"standard\" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.\n\nThe most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.\n\nTetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Tose"],"publishers":["Bullet-Proof Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":787536000,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3a6q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":383289,"name":"Sunken Sky","summary":"Welcome to the world of Sunken Sky and get ready for an epic action adventure through a vast open world.

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.\n\nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.\n\nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\n\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Playtronic","Capcom","Hyundai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":653702400,"platforms":["Arcade","Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7pml.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":135223,"name":"Super Mario 64 Splitscreen Multiplayer","summary":"This mod of Super Mario 64 allows the game to be played in multiplayer mode with splitscreen, while the original game was single player only.

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.\n\nJigsaw Sudoku:\n\nThe rules of Jigsaw Sudoku are similar to standard Sudoku since you must place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to whatever the size of the puzzle is) into each of the rows and columns. However, whereas standard Sudoku also has rectangular boxes that must each contain every number, in Jigsaw Sudoku these boxes are replaced by different bold-lined shapes that must each contain every number instead. \n\nKiller Sudoku:\n\nKiller Sudoku puzzles include all the rules of regular Sudoku but add in dashed-line 'cages' which must sum to given values. Killer Sudoku is also sometimes known as Sumdoku, Mathdoku or Addoku. The name 'Killer' Sudoku arises because of the wicked twist on the standard Sudoku puzzle, since you must not only place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to the size of the puzzle) into each of the rows, columns, and bold-lined 3x3 (or other sizes) boxes but you must also place the numbers into each dashed-line cage so that they add up to its given total - and without repeating a digit in a dashed-line cage.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Konstructors Entertainment"],"publishers":["indienova"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1565222400,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co202y.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":122024,"name":"Super Bora Dragon Eyes","summary":"Run, jump and collect gold coins.

There's also a 4-Players Mode featuring 10 stages where all four armies fight each other as well as four new final stages for each side upon completing the first 15 stages in either 2-Player Mode, for a total of 42 stages.\n\nAs in the original game, one can choose which army will be controlled by a player and which one will be controlled by the computer. A new feature in Super Famicom Wars allows the player to select the General for each army. There are seven Generals, each with his or her own unique ability. There are also eight new units and new facilities such as labs and rail stations.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Intelligent Systems"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":893980800,"platforms":["Wii","Wii U","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2w0g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":175964,"name":"Super Mario 64 2","summary":"Super Mario 64 2 was the tentative title for a Mario game in development that served as the direct sequel to Super Mario 64, intended for release in 1999.

The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.\n\nThis version would later get re-released as the expanded \"Event Version\", which added a ranking system, followed by other two \"Event Versions\" released for the Satellaview. Another expanded version of the game, called Sutte Hakkun as well, was released as a Nintendo Power downloadable game, containing many levels left out of the Satellaview broadcast due to the Satellaview 8MB Memory Pak size.

The objective of Qix is to fence off, or “claim”, a supermajority of the playfield. At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix — a sticklike entity that performs graceful, but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle.\n\nThe player controls a small diamond-shaped marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle, with the goal to claim as much of the screen as possible via drawing Stix. When the player completes a closed shape, the captured area becomes solid and points are awarded. To complete a level, the player must claim most of the playfield. (The game was shipped at 75 percent, but the arcade operator could adjust the requirement between 50 percent and 90 percent.)\n\nThe player has a limited number of lives and can lose a life if the Qix touches a Stix line as it is being drawn, or by being touched by Sparx - enemies that traverse all playfield edges except uncompleted Stix. Additionally, a Fuse appears if the marker stops moving whilst in the process of drawing Stix, disappearing when the player starts moving again. The player has no ability to defend themselves, and all enemies must be outmaneuvered.\n\nA Time Meter located at the top of the screen is responsible for the countdown of the entry of additional Sparx and the mutation of all Sparx to Super-Sparx, which have the ability to chase the player even up an unfinished Stix line.\n\nAfter the player completes two levels, the difficulty increases. This includes multiple Qixes and Sparxes, speed increases, and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparxes.\n\nSuperlite 1500 Series - Battle Qix is the latest game in the Qix series, and it was only released on the Playstation console.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Billiken Soft"],"publishers":["Success"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1035417600,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob3nr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":70261,"name":"Super Bubsy","summary":"In this version of \"Bubsy In: Claws Encounter of the Furred Kind\" for Windows 95 the graphics have been redrawn for a higher resolution, new game elements and as well as the entire Bubsy television pilot has been added.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["Pallas"],"publishers":["Tradewest Inc","D4 Enterprise","SNK","K Amusement Leasing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":685324800,"platforms":["Neo Geo AES","Arcade","Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Wii","Neo Geo CD","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co82w7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":20413,"name":"Super Mutant Alien Assault","summary":"\"Taking up arms solo or with a friend, you must dance with death in a brutal and addictive arcade platformer shooter inspired by Super Crate Box and stuffed to the brim with unlockables.\n\nFight through rapid fire single screen levels each with a random combination of platform layout, objective, vending machines and enemies.

One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Nintendo EAD","Nintendo"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":93.92857142857143,"release_date":1384992000,"platforms":["Wii U"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob8wi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":22301,"name":"Super Mario 64 DS","summary":"Super Mario 64, the classic 3D platformer for the Nintendo 64, arrives on the Nintendo DS with all-new features that take advantage of the portable system's dual screens, touch screen, and wireless multiplayer capability.

The speed-up power-up makes even slow draw fast, and fast draw faster, but the speed-down power-up negates that effect - and heaven help you if you hit the latter while already operating at normal speed.\n\nAs with just about every Qix variation since the bizarre Super Qix, claiming space on the playing field also gradually reveals an animè-style picture of a girl; I'll never truly understand why the original Qix underwent this transformation from a game of pure geometrics to a game of revealing pictures, but hey, it really doesn't affect the game.\n\nLetting Qix 2000 sit on its startup screen for a bit will eventually show you the original arcade attract mode in both graphics sets (with a few Kanji subtitles here and there - Qix is a rarity in that it originated from Taito's U.S. operation, and therefore it's always only had on-screen instructions in English).\n\nThe most important new features of the PlayStation version are the vibration function and the new arrangement mode.\n\nSPACE CHASER:\nSpace Chaser was an arcade machine made by Taito in the year 1979 which is comprised of 3 boards. Space Chaser was a 2-Dimensional maze racing game. You control your rocket through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the rocket, or rockets, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.\n\nSpace Chaser 2000 is a remake of the classic Taito arcade machine that features the Original mode with the arcade graphics and a new Arrangement mode with enhanced graphics, new backgrounds and vibration function.\n\nCRAZY BALLOON 2000:\nCrazy Balloon was first released in 1980 as an arcade machine by Taito. This is a game of strategy and skill! The object of Crazy Balloon is to guide a delicate swaying balloon through a maze of pin wheel obstacles.\n\nThe PlayStation version features the dual shock vibration function and 2 different game modes: The original game and an arrangement mode that features remastered graphics.\n\nThe player will try to get a balloon from one point to the end of a spike-walled maze, without popping it. The balloon constantly sways back and forth so you must be cautious. You cannot take all day because you are timed, as well. To make matters worse, in the later levels, you face moving spikes, Hurricane Man, who will try to blow you into a wall, and magnets that try to drag you into the wall.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Success"],"publishers":["Success"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1011830400,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cobb46.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245731,"name":"Super Soakdown","summary":"Super Soakdown is a fun and cartoony multiplayer third-person shooter game about cats with water guns.

The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle"],"developers":["indieszero Co., Ltd.","Nintendo R&D2"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":901929600,"platforms":["Wii","Wii U","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co38vb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":119037,"name":"Super Naughty Maid","summary":"Leona is your cute and lewd maid who will do anything for her master.

According to the game's instruction manual, the player controls a skateboarding hero who is late for Sunday school. In the game, the hero must use his skateboard and any objects he finds, such as balloons, grapefruits, and newspapers, to defeat bullies, clowns, and businessmen who are attempting to impede his path to Sunday school. The Sunday Funday game cartridge included two features other than the game itself - an arcade-style game titled Fish Fall and a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him. Sunday Funday is a ripped-off version of Menace Beach, also released by Color Dreams, excepting a few graphics and a complete story change. While the hero in Menace Beach fights ninjas and evil clowns on his way to rescue his girlfriend from Demon Dan, the hero in Sunday Funday fights bullies and businessmen on his way to Sunday school. Additionally, the hero carries a bible in Sunday Funday but not in Menace Beach. Finally, in Menace Beach, the hero's girlfriend appears wearing less and less clothing between levels, but she is replaced by a fully clothed Sunday school teacher in Sunday Funday.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Wisdom Tree"],"publishers":["Wisdom Tree"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820368000,"platforms":["Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6ow0.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"22828","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-22828/"}]},{"igdb_id":5197,"name":"Summer Sports: Paradise Island","summary":"Check into the Paradise Island Resort and explore the vast array of recreational activities in a lush tropical environment.

It is a cel-shaded locked-view fighting game much like Street Fighter IV, and includes more than a dozen characters from each publisher's catalog, including contemporary series as well as older classic titles.\n\nThe game features three main modes. First, there is arcade mode, which pits the player against seven randomly-selected characters in order. Next is quest mode, which plays more like a scrolling beat-em-up and tasks the player with fulfilling various time-limited objectives like destroying targets or collecting keys, and which can be played solo or with up to three friend in wireless co-op. Last is the free battle mode, where the player can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play.\n\nThe game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves.

It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game.\n\nSuper Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board. Every time the player fails to complete a puzzle, the player's health will deplete, as indicated by Arle or Rulue's expression gradually getting more distressed. If the player's health depletes completely, they'll receive a Game Over and can either choose to continue from the last save or quit back to the title. The player can recover completely if the gauges on the right side of the screen fills completely and rank up, with each cleared puzzle filling it gradually. On the pause menu, the player has the option to skip a puzzle at the cost of health.\n\nThere are five game modes: Arle's Roux, Rulue's Roux, Road to Chains, Endless Puyo, and Editor. In the first three modes, the player must solve the presented tasks with a set of available Puyo. Arle's Roux focuses on a scenario with Arle, acting as the normal course with her puzzles only involving standard Puyo. Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area. Road to Chains acts as a challenge mode where the player is given a series of puzzles to solve at a gradually increasing difficulty, with the player being unable to restore health.\n\nThe Endless Puyo mode is a regular endless mode except that 6 next Puyo are shown instead of 1 next Puyo, and that nuisance Puyo will fall in the higher levels of difficulty. The Editor mode allows you to place Puyo freely in a manner similar to Practice Notebook in Puyo Puyo 7. You can also set a list of next Puyo and the task to be solved.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Compile"],"publishers":["Banpresto","St. GIGA"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":801446400,"platforms":["Satellaview","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3jha.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":317688,"name":"Super Smash Bros.

It incorporates a 'good/evil character' morality/alignment system. Like its predecessor Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985), the player has a morality meter that can be aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of experience points, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a statistic called \"MF\" (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps will appear across the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear in the form of random items found around Fairyland. The player can also kill good monsters, which usually lowers the morality meter. Unlike Hydlide II, however, the morality meter no longer affects the way in which the townsfolk react to the player. \n \nThe game also features an in-game clock setting day-night cycles, where the character must eat two times a day and sleep regularly. If the characters stay up late or fail to eat regularly, their HP and attack power gradually drop. Every item in the game (including money) has weight. If the total weight of items the player character carries exceeds their \"Load Capacity\" (LC), they will move slowly. The game uses cut scenes for its opening and ending sequences, a combat system similar to Ys, a choice between four distinct character classes, and a wide variety of equipment and spells.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["T&E Soft","T&E Soft"],"publishers":["Seismic","T&E Soft","Namco Limited","Asmik Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":564537600,"platforms":["PC-8800 Series","Sharp X1","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Family Computer","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2srm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":201948,"name":"Super Gosu Cars","summary":"Arcade racing action mixed with kart racing combat!

Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.\nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \"slow cones\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \"zippers\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.\nPlayers have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling \"Nintendo\" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the \"Racer\" to the \"Speed demon\" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle. If players spell \"Nintendo\" while racing with the Spiker, then they win the game.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Rare"],"publishers":["Nintendo","Playtronic"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2wgf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":198095,"name":"Supernova","summary":"Dash through procedurally-generated levels with destructible obstacles and blast apart enemies with upgradable weapons in this EDM-themed runner/FPS hybrid!","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Beh3D"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1649980800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4o7h.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":41754,"name":"Super Boy I","summary":"Super Boy I is a pirated clone of Super Mario Bros., made by Zemina.

The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution.\n\nCompleted puzzles are always a type of Latin square with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same 9x9 playing board row or column or in any of the nine 3x3 subregions of the 9x9 playing board.\n\nThe puzzle was popularized in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning single number. It became an international hit in 2005.\n\nSuperLite 1500 Series - Suudoku 5 is the fifth sudoku game in the series for the Playstation One console that features over 200 different sudoku challenges.

Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.\n\nBut this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.\n\nFurthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal, they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.\n\nWhen you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used.

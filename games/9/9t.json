[{"igdb_id":11440,"name":"9th Company: Roots of Terror","summary":"9th Company Roots of Terror is an action-oriented real-time strategy game based on actual events that took place during the Soviet military campaign in Afghanistan.\n\n9th Company follows the story of a ragged band of young recruits undergoing brutal training in Uzbekistan’s Fergana Valley and culminates with a bloody stand against the Mujahideen warriors on a nameless mountain top in Afghanistan. It’s the Battle of Thermopylae all over again: one Russian fighter against 10 Afghanis!\n\n9th Company recreates in detail the events that took place during the last large-scale Soviet military operation. Few know the history: the 9th Company of the 345th Guards Airborne Regiment came under heavy fire on “Hill 3234” on January 7th, 1988. They managed to stop several attacks by an estimated 400 Mujahideen and Pakistani mercenaries and held their position for two gory days. The company lost 6 men, and the remaining 28 of the total 39 were wounded. Two 9th Company soldiers were posthumously awarded the Golden Star medal and the title of Soviet Hero.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"developers":["Lesta Studio"],"publishers":["Strategy First"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1259798400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ktn.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"102675","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/9th%20Company:%20Roots%20of%20Terror"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"12480","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/12480"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"41044","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-41044/"}]},{"igdb_id":36407,"name":"9th Dawn II","summary":"A large scale fully openworld RPG full of fast-paced action, dungeon crawling, with single or multiplayer adventures!

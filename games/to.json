Only garnering an official release in Japan, Radia Senki puts players in the shoes of an amnesiac protagonist who can be named. While in search of his own memories, the protagonist soon encounters other characters such as Darth, a man out for revenge, and a mysterious princess and together they roam the game world in search of answers to various questions that plague their lives. As per the times in Tecmo's development antics, the game features cinematic cutscenes and musical stylings similar to that of their critically-acclaimed Ninja Gaiden.\n\nRadia Senki features gameplay mechanics that are unconventional for its period, only being commonly adopted in strategy RPGs and other game types in later hardware generations. While there are fundamental RPG components in place such as equipment, shops, town exploration, and experience points, the actual combat takes place in real-time. The player only controls the protagonist directly, but can issue different strategic commands to other party members that, in turn, influence their AI as they fight. Furthermore, while fights do consist of random encounters, they take place on the same playing field as the game world itself, meaning that there are no transitions into battle-specific arenas like turn-based RPGs at the time such as Final Fantasy. Experience points are also gained in real-time as each character defeats enemies. When battles have concluded, the player receives complimentary items before being whisked back to the point on the map where they were walking prior to the fighting.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":692755200,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":121337,"name":"Touhou Multi Scroll Shooting","summary":"A derivative work of Touhou Project.

Crespo's plan is to discredit Saudi Arabia, then cut off the Venezuelan supply of oil to the United States, creating an oil crisis and driving up the price of oil, which he would then sell to the US on the black market at highly inflated prices.","genres":["Shooter","Tactical"],"developers":["Ubisoft Shanghai"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":72.5,"release_date":1068163200,"platforms":["Xbox","Nintendo GameCube","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p3a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":124098,"name":"Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side: 2nd Season","summary":"Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side: 2nd Season is an an enhanced port to the Nintendo DS featuring additional content from the Playstation 2's \"Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side: 2nd Kiss\".","genres":["Simulator","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1202947200,"platforms":["Nintendo DS","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7x36.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":112079,"name":"Toast Time: Smash Up!","summary":"Fresh from the oven, Toast Time: Smash Up brings the unique toast-based recoil/reload action from cult smash hit Toast Time to the multiplayer brawler/esports genre.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Force Of Habit"],"publishers":["Force Of Habit"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1542326400,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co59ca.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":373635,"name":"Toontown Rewritten: Clear Coasts","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure"],"developers":["Toontown Rewritten Team"],"publishers":["Toons of the World Foundation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaosw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12195,"name":"Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters","summary":"Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters is a Japanese adventure game that includes adventure game and visual novel gameplay, as well as strategy role-playing elements.

Most big companies offered at least one top-down on-foot shooter, Sega naturally included. Their best-known contribution to that front in the eighties was Alien Syndrome, their tribute to the Alien series which involves two soldiers destroying frightening xenomorphs on derelict vessels.

Tomba's main method of attack is to jump on top of enemies to grab them, allowing him to hop around on them before throwing them away. This can also be used to open other objects such as eggs or treasure chests. Tomba is also able to use various projectile weapons such as maces and boomerangs and can swing on branches and poles.\n\nThe game is based around a mission system, where the main character's (Tomba's) skills are employed to complete various tasks. Completion of a mission gives a certain amount of adventure points (AP) which are required for AP boxes which contain food (which gives you AP and restores 1 space of vitality) or items, and you may for example need 50,000 AP to open one. AP is also used to gain access to special places or information later in the game. Not all missions are necessary to progress in the game, however, they are required to achieve full completion.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.\nThe game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.\nSince its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\".","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Johnson Voorsanger Productions"],"publishers":["Tec Toy","Sega","Sega Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Linux","Wii","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2rpc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":123238,"name":"Total Lockdown","summary":"Total Lockdown is a battle royale on the top floors of a giant skyscraper.

The Cyberball series is a sci-fi imagining of American Football featuring giant robots as players, and a ticking time bomb as the ball. Players run plays, in the usual configurations familiar to American football games (pass plays, run plays, and options plays), in order to progress downfield and score touchdowns. Instead of downs and conversions in the usual sense, each time a team runs a play without passing the yardage necessary to achieve a first down, the ball gets hotter, eventually becoming critical. If the team with a critical ball fails to score or achieve a first down, the ball explodes, and any robot player holding the ball at the time is destroyed as well. The game does not feature field goals.\n\nCyberball 2072 can be played either competitively or co-operatively. Each play, the offensive player plays the quarterback, and if a human player is playing on the same team, that player selects which robot they will control for that play. The defensive player(s) likewise select which robots they will control for the play, and each defensive robot player can activate a burst of speed once during the play. When a robot player is \"tackled\" -- knocked down -- it is damaged, and after a certain number of hits on previous plays, once it is hit again in a future play, it will be destroyed and fumble the ball, allowing either team to grab the ball and continue.\n\nThe game is played in six periods, and, as a team scores and/or blocks the opposing team from scoring, the team earns money which can be used to upgrade its robot players. Upgrades proceed from plastic to various tiers of metallic robots, with titanium being the highest, each of which is faster and more durable than the last. Robot players that take hits to the point of damage can be replaced before they get destroyed and fumble the ball in-play.\n\nThe arcade versions of Cyberball 2072 were released either in two-player cabinets with one screen, or in four-player cabinets with two screens. The latter version was called Tournament Cyberball 2072.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Atari Corporation"],"publishers":["Atari Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Atari Lynx"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3z46.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":55795,"name":"Toxicant","summary":"Toxicant (formerly Undermine) is an upcoming survival horror game by independent game developer and musician Adam McLellan (Snug).

They worshipped the immense supernatural powers it appeared to hold, fashioning four artefacts out of the meteorite's core material (which become the focus of the game). Shortly thereafter, the tribe laid witness to the deformed birth of their prophesied leader, born without a face, and fled Antarctica in fear of what the meteorite was capable of. In the present day, the ancient Polynesian city has been buried beneath snow and ice and RX Tech are excavating the site, investigating the meteorite. Led by Dr. Willard, the crew discovers remnants of the Polynesian city, ancient stone statues resembling the Easter Island Moai, and finds the grave of a man named Paul Caulfield of the HMS Beagle.\n\nWhen the game begins, Lara Croft is in India searching for a legendary stone in the ruins of an ancient temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. She encounters Tony, an RX Tech employee who seems to be suffering from a severe bout of jungle fever. After parting ways, Tony remains one step ahead of Lara in their search for the stone, eventually finding it hidden deep within an underground cavern. After killing an oddly superhuman Tony, Lara takes the stone and exits.

Reimu can knock and maneuver the Yin-Yang orb around by whacking it with her gohei, slide-tackling it, and firing shots at it. Enemies will be trying to hinder your progress by firing at you, but you can cancel out their shots with your own, or even deflect them by swinging your gohei. Only the Yin-Yang orb can damage the enemies, however, so simply firing your shots at enemies will have no effect. As a last resort, Reimu can use a \"bomb\", once per life, to hit all cards on the screen. There is no guarantee that any given card will be hit, and will often fail to damage a boss.\n\nThe game consists of several stages of increasing difficulty, with a boss fight occurring every five stages. To complete a stage, the player should clear all cards or defeat the boss. Reimu will lose a life whenever she is hit by an enemy projectile or the yin-yang orb.\n\nThere are two selectable paths in the game: the Hell path and the Makai path. Each route features unique stages, bosses, and endings.","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Team Shanghai Alice"],"publishers":["Team Shanghai Alice"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":846806400,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5ueo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":55760,"name":"Torej","summary":"Torej is a puzzle game where the goal is to build a tower without it collapsing and falling of the platform.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1504656000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":25660,"name":"Total War: Warhammer - Blood For the Blood God","summary":"Blood for The Blood God brings a number of gory new mature-rated effects to Total War: Warhammer.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["The Creative Assembly"],"publishers":["Feral Interactive","Sega Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1467244800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qhuey7bwzh8iqyanxpkb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":246681,"name":"Touhou Danmuki: Spellbroken Dream Festival","summary":"A Touhou fangame created by Incandesence System.

This entails completing various goals across three different categories: Career, Hardcore, and Neutral. By accomplishing these goals, you earn money that can be used to enhance your skate park. As you tackle enough challenges, professional skaters make appearances, and their challenges, when completed, allow you to acquire new skate park elements and advance to the next level.\n\nThis version of the game incorporates certain gameplay features from the console versions. Aggro kicking enables the player to gain speed more rapidly. Some missions involve executing Gesture Tricks, where you replicate motions on the touch screen, reminiscent of the Nail The Trick feature in the console versions. Most missions are completed at different difficulty levels, and challenges are scattered throughout the levels, both of which were introduced in Project 8. However, this version lacks the open world design. The downtown areas of Philly and Baltimore are absent, and the Air & Space Museum incorporates elements of the National Mall. Additionally, several levels have been redesigned to suit the hardware, with Lansdowne being the most notable example. The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions' skate lounge is replaced by a sizable customizable skatepark.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Vicarious Visions"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1192406400,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6hrc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":57058,"name":"Touch Selections","summary":"Two RCMADIAX games bundled together.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1473292800,"platforms":["Wii U"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nw8w9mdhe5k44splg8ps.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":124705,"name":"TokoToko","summary":"Solve riddles by drawing on real paper and help Hako find the other Tokotokos in a cute and fun story – all this through augmented reality.

Taking place in a kingdom with tomatoes abound, the gameplay is similar to that of the Mario & Luigi series.\n\nTomato Adventure, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is the predecessor of the Mario & Luigi series of games, even having its engine reused in the first installment on the GameBoy Advance. Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version.\n\nTomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point.

This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.\n\nYou get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks.

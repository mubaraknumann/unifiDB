Maybe he's a trendy veggie? I see you're going to need further clues.\n\nMuncher Man's house looks suspiciously like a maze, with lots of little round bits of food in it (Not yet! Wait a bit). You have to wander about the maze, eating the food, and avoiding the ghouls (now you can start guessing).\n\nWhen you eat a special pill (left over from a previous police raid), you can chase and eat the ghouls (but go easy on the spirits), getting a large bonus from your local exorcist as you do so.(You must have it by now). Fruits pop up in the maze at random.\n\nWhat do you mean, \"I haven't got it yet?\" Insert tape in ear, press any key and re-read from start. This fiippin' well is Pac Man, however deceptive the picture of the dinosaur might be on the cover. Mind you, with names like Classic Muncher, Back Man, or Ghost Gobbling or some such, waddya expect? Asteroids?\n\nYou certainly don't get many hints from the loading screen - there isn't one. Another missing link is the sound effects - not exactly stunning, to say the least. At least you can use your own idea of keyboard and/or joystick layout.\n\nThe sneaky bit that got me at the end of the first screen was that they went and changed the maze around. You don't see that on many Pac Man clones, though this one certainly swiped enough memory for several different maps.\n\nIf you're into being grabbed by the ghoulies in the hedges with some fruit, then you could do worse than buy this one.

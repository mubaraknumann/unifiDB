The game was released as a largely unfinished product and many parts of it do not work properly at all.\n\nThe packaging of Big Rigs states that the main objective of the game is to race a semi-trailer truck (known colloquially as a \"big rig\") in order to safely deliver illegal cargo being carried by the vehicle, while avoiding the local police force. In actuality, there are no police in the game, no such objectives are presented within the game itself and there is no load attached to the truck.[1] Much of the game instead centers on the player racing their truck against fellow drivers to the finish line; however, in the earlier versions the player's computer-controlled opponent vehicles have no AI and never move from the starting position. In a later version, the computer-controlled opponent will race around the track, but will stop just before crossing the finish line. The timer in the game is merely aesthetic and has no limit on the gameplay. In addition, due to a lack of collision detection, there are no obstacles to navigate within the game, and the player is able to phase through environments and leave the game altogether.\n\nBig Rigs: Over the Road Racing was critically panned. The game's criticism is largely directed at its \"blatantly unfinished\"[2] state: lack of collision detection and frequent violation of the laws of physics, frequent and major software bugs, poor visuals, and severe lack of functionality.

Two players who pretend to be lovers. They pretend to be lovers separated from each other by lightyears of deep space. They have lonely walks along the shore of a simulated ocean, thinking wistful thoughts of each other. Thoughts from ancient Earth literature by Marguerite Duras.\n\nThe empty beach, the strong wind, the gentle music and a small colony of electric seagulls are their only companions. Yet their heart is full and their mind confused. Walk along the shore, until they meet the emptiness.\n\nWhen it all becomes too much, they run towards each other. Enabled by intergalactic networks, they touch each other’s holographic bodies in cyberspace. A surreal game of chess becomes the apparatus through which they, man and woman, can talk. The words they have were given to them, as they have always been to lovers everywhere.\n\nThe sea remains, tugging at their hearts when not at their hairs and clothes, as it itself is tugged by the virtual moon. And as great as the desire for the other may be, they cannot stay away from the wind and the waves and the sand. Every time they find a new treasure. An abandoned tennis field. An heap of coal. A dead dog. Ordinary. Absurd. Meaningless. Yet comforting.\n\nEnter a café, exit a villa, enter a casino, exit the ruin of an ancient colonial mansion. We know this is not real. So it doesn’t surprise us. Nothing surprises us. It doesn’t matter when you feel the pain of love. Of being in love, of falling in love, of leaving in love. There is no such thing as time.

Action-Strategy games are also called \"hybrids\" because they combine the FPS and RTS elements into the most engaging gaming experience available for the PC. Bionite: Origins integrates the key FPS and RTS elements into one seamless battle experience. Action-Strategy games are the most engaging games to play; because they require strategy to win, AND are fun to play because they include the First Person Shooter experience.\n\nThe game includes 3 maps; The Emze Mine (located on Venus), Biodome 24 (located on Mars), and Hadley’s Hope (located on the Moon). This release is a single player version against the computer (Skirmish mode) which involves destroying the enemy base before the enemy destroys your base. It is also intended to introduce gamers to the complex command system used in the game. There is a learning curve for Bionite: Origins and requires some time to develop the skills necessary to lead a successful campaign against the enemy. We like to think of the game as “Chess on Steroids”. It requires players to understand how to develop successful military strategies while relying on vehicle-driving skills to win and advance in rank.\n\nBionite: Origins took over 6 years to develop. There is no DLC, all of the content is included in the original release. All future releases of the game are free to people that already have a purchased copy of the game. When the Full Version of the game is released on Steam, everyone that purchased a copy of the game in Early Access will get the Fulll Version at no cost.

The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).\n\nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.\n\nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.\n\nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Angel"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":727315200,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9gzo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38591,"name":"Bishi Bashi Championship Mini Game Senshuken","summary":"A collection of mini games that can support up to 3 players using red, green and blue buttons.","genres":["Puzzle","Arcade"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":833587200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co964n.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38592,"name":"Birdiy","summary":"You control a mama bird that attempts to catch a caterpillars on the tree leafs and a worms under the ground taking caution not to be attacked by a skunk, to later feed her little chick on the nest and protect from stealthy predators.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":439084800,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8i8f.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38593,"name":"Birdie Try","summary":"A golf game that was released in Japan.","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["Data East Corporation"],"publishers":["Data East Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":581126400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co76tw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38594,"name":"Bikkuri Card","summary":"A card matching game released in 1987 in Japan.","genres":["Puzzle","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co70ju.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38595,"name":"Big Twin","summary":"Big Twin is a simple arcade puzzle game in which different coloured spheres continually drop down into the playfield and must be removed as quickly as possible.

One of the Tenshi said to the young Fuu, \"Your parents were \"Dealers\", who are people that sell \"Hoshi\".

Akin to snowboarding, the sports popularity is spreading like wildfire around the globe. Evolving from a combination of waterskiing, snowboarding, skating and surfing, wakeboarding is not only the world's fastest-growing water board sport but also the most accessible. It can be done on waterski lakes or on the sea. Riders are able to perform amazing BIG AIR tricks (Backwash, Bindings, Edge, Fakie etc), whilst being towed behind a boat, with the use of big boards and big wakes. The rider stands sideways on a shorter, wider board similar in concept to a snowboard. If you have no imagination, look at these shots from real wakeboarding (shot1, shot2, shot3). So now I think you have an idea kind of sport wakeboarding is, so back to the game. \nBig Air Wakeboarding features over eight distinct characters, hundreds of different mind-bending trick combos, multiple jumps and obstacles, real wakeboards from O'Brien, and Darin Shapiro - the 2000 X Games and Pro Wakeboard Tour Champion. In the game you can choose from Career, Competition and Quick Start. In Career mode you have to collect Gas cans, to improve your character over time.These Gas cans unlock new board graphics and improve on the quality of all boards. Gas can also unlock better boats with bigger wakes and more advanced tie-ins. In Competition you got three runs out in the open water to try and rack up the most points - any medal in a competition will unlock the next course. If you like skateboarding and snowboarding games, maybe this game could be quite interesting for you.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Activision Value"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1007164800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ihttzw6jfynibmss6lcz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":64287,"name":"Bikkuriman Daijikai","summary":"An interactive database and quiz game based around the Bikkuriman collectible sticker franchise.

This version of solitaire is what generally is called Windows Solitaire, or what some people think Solitaire just is as a general term (when the truth is that Solitaire is a huge genre of games just as wide as FPS is).\n\nBig Klondike features 1 Draw, 3 Draw, Random shuffles and Winnable shuffles. You can choose to have the Timer enabled or not if you prefer a relaxing experience.\n\nOur Winnable shuffles are originally Random shuffles which our custom coded solitaire bot has play tested to ensure is actually possible. We ship the game with 50,000 known Winnable shuffles for both 1 Draw and 3 Draw variations. The 1.0.0 version of our solitaire bot was made to not be too incredibly clever, so all Winnable shuffles are guaranteed to be possible below 200 moves. Though a Winnable game is guaranteed to be possible, that does not mean you will always win it first time as sometimes moves can be made in ways where the game becomes bricked - impossible to finish in that state. If that happens you can Retry that same game and go for different moves to beat it!\n\nIn Big Klondike, cards can be dragged or clicked to move them to possible moves. Right click is also supported.\n\nOnce a game is deemed as mostly complete, Big Klondike will show a button to Auto Complete the game and move the rest of the cards into place in the foundations.","genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Subsoap"],"publishers":["Subsoap"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1631059200,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5bm9.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1706340","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706340"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"99208075","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Big%20Klondike%20-%20Classic%20Solitaire"}]},{"igdb_id":168488,"name":"Big Fish","summary":"Explore an underwater dystopian graveyard of giant creatures that once swam the seas.

Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.\n\nPlaying as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor. Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin' guitar solo. If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint.\n\nOther items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future. Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that \"they\" left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game's puzzles.\n\nA password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player's progress.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Al Baker & Associates"],"publishers":["Atari Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Atari Lynx"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3z3t.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":175995,"name":"Bionicle: City of Legends","summary":"Bionicle: City of Legends is a cancelled 3D action-adventure and platformer game based on the Lego Bionicle Series.

Here you are a Birdie in some sci-fi world filled with robots, carnivorous plants, parachutes, raptors, barbarians, lasers, butterflies, magical doors, hyperspace, etc. You should survive in this world with help of your wings and flying techniques.\n\nThe game is flown in third-person view, where you may control a bird moving him/her left or right, flying up or descending down, and flapping the wings. To fly correctly, the bird has to move in the air at a certain speed. Once the latter increases, the bird is handy. If bird's speed drops below a certain threshold, the bird then follows one of the oldest laws of the universe, gravity. Flapping wings enables bird to gain altitude and flying down on the wings increases speed.\n\nThe scoreboard on the screen tells you your speed (red = stall), altitude, the remaining time before the night, your life energy (no energy = game over). Flying at altitude for too long will attract predators, give no points, and exhaust the energy unnecessarily. Eating butterflies allows you to recover energy, but remember that eating too much makes you aggressive!\n\nThe environment, where Birdie is flying, will change during the game. Starting in the forest, you will visit other dimensions through Magical Doors as well as descend the dungeons, and even meet lamas.","genres":["Simulator","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["ERE International"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9psg.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1745766439","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Birdie"}]},{"igdb_id":341270,"name":"BingeWatcher","summary":"BingeWatcher is a daily game/trivia for cinema enthusiastics: each day at midnight, it will challenge you to find the title of a movie selected among the top grossing films of the played country.\nTo do so, the player have to reveal the details of the movie existing on its wikipedia page.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1744243200,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9plq.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"341191999","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/BingeWatcher"}]},{"igdb_id":341547,"name":"Binding of Isaac Bundle","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":341625,"name":"Big City Adventure: London Story","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Jolly Bear Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1334102400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9q77.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"110896665","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Big%20City%20Adventure:%20London%20Story"}]},{"igdb_id":341688,"name":"Billy Hatcher Hyper Shoot","summary":"Billy Hatcher Hyper Shoot is a Game Boy Advance multiboot game that which is unlocked by connecting to the Nintendo GameCube via the Nintendo GameCube - Game Boy Advance Link Cable.

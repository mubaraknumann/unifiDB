On start-up the player would enter a name, selected either a male or female character avatar, and then move the avatar around a virtual town. Houses and shops in the town served as download locations where the player could directly download games, particular game data, or digital magazines. The download would write game data into temporary memory locations which would remain until the player downloaded a new game to take its place.\n\nApart from downloads, players could also travel to in-game locations such as the Wall Newspaper Co. (かべ新聞社 kabe shinbunsha?) to read brief text-only postcard-like messages from St.GIGA and Nintendo that announced contest winners, revealed future games and future programming schedule details, and served to raise awareness for celebrity events relating to SoundLink Magazine performers' off-Satellaview activities. Furthermore, the avatar was equipped with an inventory and game currency which could be spent on various in-game items such as telephone cards, vehicle tickets, fish bait, and shoes that would enable the player to dash rather than walk everywhere.

The game is a sequel to the 1993 Hecht game for the SNES, Ihatovo Monogatari, earlier-broadcast for the Satellaview as well. Intended as a family-oriented game for all ages, the game makes reference to many classic works of Japanese children's literature.\n\nBS Ihatovo Monogatari incorporates voice narration at the start of each weekly broadcast to provide dramatic performances of Miyazawa's poetry set in Ihatovo. During gameplay, the Soundlink provides sound effects and gameplay hints for players. The game's voice actors were selected by popular vote by readers of Seiyu Zasshi and included Kikuko Inoue, Kouichi Yamadera, Yuka Imai, and Eiichi Onoda.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Hect"],"publishers":["St. GIGA","Hect"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":857260800,"platforms":["Satellaview"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3z6c.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":151577,"name":"BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2","summary":"This is the SoundLink version of BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2, which is the direct sequel to the original F-Zero game released for the Super Famicom via the Satellaview.

At least the first week rearranged a few courses, and replaced two with new locations called \"Forest I\" and \"Forest II\". Presuming no areas were repeated, this likely means the SoundLink version had twice as many courses total. In addition, it can be seen that the player cannot choose between Grand Prix and Practice modes in the SoundLink version; as it was a live broadcast, the player is forced to play each course in a timed Practice mode, and then the Grand Prix race.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Nintendo EAD"],"publishers":["St. GIGA","Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":871171200,"platforms":["Satellaview"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6nfk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":163733,"name":"BSurfing","summary":"BSurfing is a fun parkour game featuring famous mechanics, such as surfing and bhopping.

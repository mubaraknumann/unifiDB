An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structural features of the screen (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage, reprising the amusing \"victory dance walk\" into the horizon from Cabal. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies.\n\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen or special characters who may run across, such as the small Indian Chief figure or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots.

Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Alpha Denshi"],"publishers":["D4 Enterprise","SNK"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":663811200,"platforms":["Neo Geo AES","Arcade","Neo Geo MVS","Wii","Neo Geo CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22yj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":39816,"name":"Blomby Car","summary":"A rally driving game from ABM and Gecas.

However, the King has announced a dragon tournament, where the winner will not only win the princess but also become the new king.\n\nAs a young Flicker, the player must collect various objects and interact with an eccentric cast of dragon and human characters in order to solve puzzles. The player's overall quest is to become a dragon knight to compete in the grand tournament and win the heart of Princess Flame. However, the player discovers an evil human plot to take over the kingdom by kidnapping the princess.\n\nAs is the case with many other graphic adventure games, the player can never die in the game or reach a point in the game where a puzzle cannot be solved. The humour in the game is heavily influenced by the British comedy of Monty Python (the game starring former Monty Python actor Terry Jones) and thus includes plenty of mild sexual innuendos, and other shenanigans.\n\nWhile the video game leaves open the possibility for a sequel, no sequel for the game was planned.","genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Illusions Gaming Company"],"publishers":["Crystal Dynamics"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":846720000,"platforms":["Sega Saturn","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2tmc.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"19378","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-19378/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"17738","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Blazing Dragons"}]},{"igdb_id":45565,"name":"Blades of Vengeance","summary":"Blades of Vengeance is a platform game that was developed by Beam Software and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

Unique to Heat the Soul 3 are \"Soul Road\" and \"Karakura Heroes.\" In Soul Road, the player is to select the desired character and partner character. Afterwards, the player is set on a board game-like map where the goal is to pass through markers in order to fight enemies. After each match, the player is given an amount of \"Trust points\" (how many received depends on the mode's difficulty) which go towards leveling up partner characters and unlocking bonuses, such as alternate costumes and new partners. To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points; however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added. Don Kanonji leads a group of shinigami, initially Byakuya Kuchiki and Tōshirō Hitsugaya, on some sort of wacky adventure which involves battling several other characters.

Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are counted as ten points. The player and dealer can count their own Ace as 1-point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a \"hit\" (taking additional cards) to bring their total value of cards to 21 points, or as close as possible without exceeding 21 (called \"busting\"). If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called \"soft\", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; otherwise, the hand is \"hard\".\n\nThe dealer has to take hits until his cards total 17 or more points. (In some casinos, the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, e.g. initial ace and six.) Players who do not bust and have a total higher than the dealer, win. The dealer will lose if he or she busts, or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a \"push\" and the player typically doesn't win or lose money on that hand.\n\nMany rule variations of blackjack exist. Since the 1960's, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wager and playing strategies accordingly.\n\nOther casino games inspired by blackjack include Spanish 21 and pontoon. The recreational British card game of black jack is a shedding-type game and unrelated to the subject of this article.","genres":["Arcade","Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cgbdtxepu52aedxovdnn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":87386,"name":"Blue Slot 100","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1435530792","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Blue%20Slot%20100"},{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"883031822","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blue-slot-100/id883031822?mt=12&uo=4"}]},{"igdb_id":87408,"name":"Blackjack HD","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"408974874","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackjack-hd/id408974874?mt=12&uo=4"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"755497243","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Blackjack%20HD"}]},{"igdb_id":87427,"name":"Bloxorz: Rolling Block","summary":"Bloxorz is a very challenging roll puzzle game designed for every one who enjoys logic and math game.","genres":["Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Dong Tran"],"publishers":["Dong Tran"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1440720000,"platforms":["iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5qdp.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2046660534","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bloxorz:%20Rolling%20Block"},{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"1031341769","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloxorz-rolling-block/id1031341769?mt=12&uo=4"}]},{"igdb_id":87543,"name":"Block: Puzzle Game","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":87612,"name":"Block Puzzle Jewel Legend","summary":"Block Puzzle Jewel is an addictive, easy to learn game that will have your mind bending and your fingers flying.\n\nDrop blocks in order to create and destroy full lines on the screen both vertically and horizontally.\nThe more rows you eliminate at one time, the more score you will be granted.\n\nNo time limit, you can enjoy game for any time, anywhere and a short time.\nNo start screen!!!

Can you stop this new cycle of death before it's too late?\n\nKazuki's partners include the crazy and funny Ishikawa Siblings; Kaoru Moriyama, the daughter of a millionaire and founder of the organization; and Suzumi Misao, the head of the organization.\nWith a delightfully quirky cast, players will form bonds with the main characters while trying to solve the overarching case of the Phantom Killer, a criminal with a perfect track record.\n\nCurrent and Upcoming Features:\nWith around 30 hours playtime and dialogue partially voiced in English, Bloody Chronicles is divided into five action-packed chapters.\nThroughout your pursuit of the Phantom Killer, you must make serveral decisions that determine the novel's outcome. Players that enjoy replay value can expect around 70 possible decisions to explore, some of which will even influence Kazuki's \"romantic\" relationship with his female colleagues at Igrasil.\n\nAs for adult content in Bloody Chronicles, four unlockable episodes called \"IF mode\" are releasing soon and will feature Igrasil members Aki, Suzumi, Kaoru, and Akito.

Play as one of the Forsaken, the last frontier of humanity against the growing horrors of the Omnistructure. As you find yourself stranded in a faraway outpost, you must adapt in order to survive. The world won't wait for you though, you must venture into the unknown - your faith will decide your fate.\n\nFeel the burden of surviving in one of the last remaining outposts of the Forsaken, a legion of hunters condemned to protect the last vestige of humanity. The nature of your purpose however is shrouded in mystery, and as you delve deeper into the manifold halls of the Omnistructure, you will come to find the true meaning of alienation, isolation, and dread. A cross between cyberpunk, and dark fantasy - Bleak Faith will offer a story and experience that will be a breath of fresh air for all gamers looking for a something new. The world is full of lore, and every aspect of it is crafted with utmost passion and a dedication to art. As a baseline there is an estimated 30+ hours of content, a deep class system, and a procedural AI system that ensures that no playthrough is ever the same.\n\nThe architecture of the world, the Omnistructure, is a huge aspect of the game. Meticulously designed and crafted, Bleak Faith aims to provide an emergent narrative method coupled with more structured traditional moments. The world of Bleak Faith is labyrinthine, tapping into an innate curious instinct we all have when faced with many defined branching choices - we focus on creating a strong sense of curiosity about the path not taken, by offering unique and compelling content in every area of the world - having said that the world employs both vast open areas, and more linear openness in Metroidvania fashion. The aim is to evoke that same feeling of wonder and excitement that you felt the first time you played a game, the first time you experienced 3D graphics, the first time you experienced something that felt formative and not habitual. Open world in Bleak Faith is a crucial aspect to showing you the reality of the Forsaken. In this world there are few havens for the Forsaken, and these are generally outposts which serve as bases (of various complexities and utility) to recover from journeys and prepare for more - however, nowhere is truly safe!\n\nExpect tight and meticulously crafted and expanded combat that brings tempo and action to this world in amazing quality and detail. We're not shying away from a challenge, and so we're going all in. Despite being a small team, we couldn't accept a simple mundane combat system; we are making it fleshed out, and very robust. The combat communicates the danger in adrenaline-pumping fashion. Fast, responsive, and unforgiving - you will earn and feel every victory, nothing comes easy. Approach combat in your own way however - choose stealth over face-to-face combat, choose ranged over melee, choose Technomancy over more traditional combat styles. The system allows you to express yourself through combat, or through avoiding it - and that's further supported through a class system as well.\n\nHow better to experience the unyielding uncertainty of the Omnistructure than through a simulated ecosystem of factions and AI groups. Inhabitants of the Omnistructure will compete among themselves, grow and expand, change and adapt - the food chain in the ecosystem will, as a result, mold to every playthrough (e.g. an apex predator from your last playthrough might have already died out in this playthrough and you never fight it again). It's a constant race against time as enemies will try and outgrow and outsmart not only you, but other competition. Hunt, scavenge, and grow to stay on top of the food chain. Never experience an area the same way as the procedural nature of the ecosystem will ensure that you can never let your guard down. Having said that, there are still linear areas of the game, especially those that cover main plot points - to ensure a direction and purpose for the player. The ecosystem makes every moment of gameplay interesting and engaging - even on multiple playthroughs.\n\nFight against the odds, and stay alive despite the Omnistructure's evergrowing threat. Craft, scavenge, hunt, and find ways to excel. Pick a class, upgrade stats, augment your character, create equipment and stay healthy. Resist the Puppet Plague, and the many afflictions present in the world which can change the outcome of your journey entirely. Use stealth and your environment to your advantage - fighting is not always the best course of action, and when it is, preparing the field to shift the odds in your favor is a necessary tactic.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Archangel Studios"],"publishers":["Archangel Studios"],"aggregated_rating":68.33333333333333,"release_date":1678406400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3mcx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":122201,"name":"Blitzkrieg","summary":"Blitzkrieg is a tough-as-nails tower defence game from Loui Studios.

When the ball hits one of the paddle's three sections, it becomes warmer and when it is hot, bullets are shot automatically, destroying the bricks above. Particles have physics and will collide with the paddle or the walls. The player is rewarded for clearing columns and that increases the speed of the ball.\n\nThe game can be played in an endless mode or in a set of procedurally generated levels where the difficulty level is gradually increased. Destroyed bricks often leave behind power-ups such as additional balls or explosions. Diamonds can be collected as a currency to upgrade the paddle multiple times, improving the fire power.

What it has in strength and toughness, the Nurgle team lacks in agility. Nurgle Warriors have a lousy Agility value and Move rate, and do not make good ball bearers.

Also, one of their strongest characteristics is that powerful players, like bull centaurs, unlock their powerful skills very quickly.\n\nThe main weakness of the Chaos Dwarfs stands in their poor ball-handling skills. Indeed, due to their tiny size and low agility, they have to rely on hobgoblins in order to push the game forward.

You play as a tiny fox spirit that grows from lotus blossom after being blessed by the moon god. Use your legendary bō staff to bounce and move fluidly through a delightfully-demonic east asian fever dream. Use the tight movement and reset system to reach areas efficiently and gracefully or recover chaotically while floundering for footing.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Squid Shock Studios"],"publishers":["Humble Games"],"aggregated_rating":71.66666666666667,"release_date":1721174400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co87pc.jpg","external_ids":[]}]

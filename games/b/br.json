Game play for the title is based on an innovative combat system called SPMÂ (Smart Pause Mode) that successfully blends together real-time and turn-based games.\n\nUnlike standard turn-based systems, Brigade E5: New Jagged Union does not use \"action points\" while in turn-based mode, but takes into consideration the character skills and attributes resulting in more natural and diverse behavior of units. Furthermore players can issue a chain of commands that will be carried out automatically.\n\nThe choice of weapons will satisfy even highly demanding fans, with more than 100 accurately modeled firearms, varied ammunition types, grenades, body armor and special equipment. Players will be also able to modify and upgrade weapons by adding various gadgets, sniper scopes, mini grenade launchers, bayonets, etc.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Strategy","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["Apeiron Studios"],"publishers":["Strategy First"],"aggregated_rating":40.0,"release_date":1135987200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3mkw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":10233,"name":"Brawlhalla","summary":"Brawlhalla is a free platform fighting game with over 100 million players that supports up to 8 players online in a single match with full cross-play.

The mage starts out with a wand that can do a water attack. No damage shows any blood, only smokepuffs.\n\nThe orbs power source is taken from colored diamonds found in the caves: Green for Earth, Red for Fire, Blue for Water and White for Air.\nThere are also some diamonds with combined orb energy effects: Light Blue for Air & Water and Purple for Fire & Earth.\n\nThe underground Kingdom is divided into 50 platform levels, to finish a level three larger Key-diamonds must be found; one each of Green, Red and White color - these will open the door to the next level.

The player can choose between several male and female characters with pre-defined anime-style portraits, allocating points into their primary parameters. Much of the game is played solo, though a few NPCs can join the main character one at a time.

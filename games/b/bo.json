There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).\n\nThe fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent.

The game was, besides Dragon Hopper, going to be one of the games, which should have saved the system with a relaunch, but it was delayed again and again until it was cancelled because of the lack of success of the Virtual Boy. At this time, the game already was completely finished.\n\nIn Bound High!, Chalvo, the bouncing robot, travels through space In full 3d-D motion in pursuit of alien invaders that threaten the peaceful inhabitants of Earth. Angling from above, players control rolled up Chalvo, who must destroy all enemies on the playfield by landing on them and throwing them down from the playfield. Falling off the playfield himself, Chalvo will loose a life.\nThe playfield is in space, or high above the earth, and is made of many little squares, which are composed differently from level to level, once big plain areas, once many small, scattered blocks. Bouncing over the platforms can be quite incalculable and dangerous, while some are solid, other ones vanish after one hit or reveal puzzles, items or other objects and besides a lot of different enemies, Chalvo also has to carefully avoid winds, the deep crevices, sharp spikes and highly charged electric \"shockers\" that cause his demise. Adding to the difficulty is the rebound angle when you hit a moving enemy - you don't necessarily bounce straight up in the air.\nSometimes blocks lead to an \"Another Stage\", some kind of mirrored parallel universe with inverted colors and without the dangerous winds.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Japan System Supply"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Virtual Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa4st.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"49830","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-49830/"}]},{"igdb_id":50701,"name":"Bomberman Blast","summary":"Look out for Bomberman Blast!

The sequel is set in a Japanese southern coastal town on the tropical Izu Peninsula where his aunt and uncle have a bed and breakfast.\n\nThe game consists of fixed screen, pre-rendered environments with 3D models and a cinematic camera with a different viewpoint for each scene. Boku's vacation only lasts 31 days, but the player is free to choose how to spend his time as it is presented as a sandbox environment. It is possible to seek quests and help the people in town to solve their problems, but he can also choose to ride his bike anywhere, go bughunting, spend time fishing, dive into the ocean, launch a rocket, go on walk, play hide and seek, or play a mini-game of beetle wrestling. Many scenes offer interaction for the sake of exploration, with no further purpose. Time advances when a new scene is entered, so it is not possible to complete all content in a single playthrough.","genres":["Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":["Millennium Kitchen"],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1026345600,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2uew.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":66567,"name":"Boulder Match","summary":"Similar to Boulder Dash and the first version of Boulder Match series.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wnkutm9asklawthyxbpo.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"28257","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Boulder%20Match"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"31382","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-31382/"}]},{"igdb_id":66568,"name":"Boulder Match 3","summary":"Similar to Boulder Dash and the third version of Boulder Match series.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r8muko6fceobgcbkzak3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"31381","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-31381/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"28254","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Boulder%20Match%203"}]},{"igdb_id":66613,"name":"Bomberman Story DS","summary":"Bomberman Story DS is a sequel to Bomberman Tournament that was released in Japan and Europe.","genres":[],"developers":["Hudson Soft"],"publishers":["Rising Star Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1195776000,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9u4q.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"28121","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bomberman%20Story%20DS"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"31234","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-31234/"}]},{"igdb_id":66673,"name":"Boulder Match 4","summary":"The player has to collect treasures before time runs out.

Everyone expected the league leaders to roll into town and easily defeat the home team. But the scrappy upstarts have played the game of their lives and managed to keep the score tied right until the end. Their fatigue is showing and now it's their last chance. If the home team batters don’t score a run now, the visitors will be sure to win the game in extra innings. It all comes down to the Bottom of the 9th!\n\nWill you lead the underdogs to victory? Or will you defend the league leaders’ unbroken winning streak?\n\nBottom of the 9th is a strategic 2-player baseball game played with cards and dice. This faithful adaptation brings the fast-paced fun of the tabletop game to your phone and tablet! Choose your lineup from a pool of players with different strengths and abilities, outsmart your opponent in the stare-down, then roll the dice to trigger the action.\n\nBottom of the 9th offers many ways to play:\n• Compete in single player against a computer opponent (3 levels of difficulty)\n• Take on the Manager's Challenge 6-game solo campaign mode\n• Pass and play on your device with a friend\n• Challenge a friend to play online\n• Find a worthy opponent in a ranked online match\n• Organize a casual online exhibition game\n\nThe powerhouse visitors have 6 dynamite pitchers to choose from, including:\n• Wake Louder throws a nasty knuckleball that can get a lost ball just into the edge of the strike zone.\n• Southpaw Straw is a talented lefty pitcher with one dangerously effective (and illegal) spitball.\n• Hurricane Patriss is a top notch reliever, and the only thing more hypnotic than his curveball is his voice.\n\nDon't count out the home team! They have a dozen batters, each with their own special powers, including:\n• Mully Nomah can be devastating against the pitching team when runners are in scoring position. He can clobber a pitch and get those base runners home!\n• Kerry Rumble has power behind her swing. She has the ability to crush the ball hard, at the cost of hitting lots of fouls. She just can’t resist taking a swing!\n• K.C. Petty is truly a powerhouse when the chips are down. The more strikes he gets, the bigger he swings.\n• Hannah Cait may look innocent, but when she's in the zone she calls all the shots! This rookie's level of control over her swing is the envy of many a veteran.\n\nBoth teams have access to 2 support characters who provide special abilities to one or both teams:\n• Dice Dixon has no problem taking chances coming out from the dugout, benching batters and challenging umps!\n• Doc Mullins is always looking after the health of the team, whether that means a more rested pitcher or more energized batters!\n\nThe Manager's Challenge solo campaign mode puts you right in the dugout as a team manager. Can you lead your team to the playoffs in a 6-game homestand?\n• Play 6 game solo campaigns as the home team against a revolving cast of pitchers.\n• Compete in 9 different game situations, including multiple inning games.\n• Each campaign game is played using one of 6 effect cards that change the feel of the game.\n\n~~~ There’s nothing that’s quite like the thrill you feel in the Bottom of the 9th! ~~~\n\nCompatible with Android devices with NEON CPU support. Older devices with Tegra 2 CPUs are not compatible.

No one man was given supreme command of all French forces in Spain, and French operations – though frequently successful on a local level, were marred by a lack of cooperation. This was made yet worse by Napoleon's own attempts to run the war by remote control from Paris, sending written orders that were out of date even before they were dispatched. \n \nThough often defeated, and similarly bereft of central control for the early years of the war, the Spanish leaders kept on putting fresh armies into the field, while the civilian populace refused to surrender and fought a bloody guerrilla war against the invaders. This tied down a large part of the French forces, limiting the numbers available to pursue further conquests. As a result, once their initial occupying army had been driven out in 1808, the French were never able to conquer Portugal, which was defended by its own reorganized forces and by a growing British contingent. The British were led by Arthur Wellesley, a man of outstanding ability who would subsequently get the better of Napoleon himself at Waterloo. Although initially the French had the upper hand, the reorganization of the Portuguese army by Beresford and the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras secured Portugal from French conquest. Thereafter, Portugal would become the base for the Anglo-Portuguese army that would eventually join with the Spanish to evict the French from the Peninsula. \n \nBonaparte's Peninsular War will take you through battles and campaigns focused in and around Portugal, but also branch out into Spain for some of the early war actions of 1809. The balance of the Peninsular conflict is covered in a follow-up title currently in development. For further details you may read the Designers Notes.","genres":["Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1830283716","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bonaparte's%20Peninsular%20War"}]},{"igdb_id":144933,"name":"Bombing!!: A Graffiti Sandbox","summary":"Bombing!!: A Graffiti Sandbox is a lo-fi creative graffiti simulator where every inch of the environment can be painted.","genres":["Simulator","Indie"],"developers":["Devon Wiersma"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1621296000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2x3h.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"846523940","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bombing!!:%20A%20Graffiti%20Sandbox"},{"category":30,"store":"itch","uid":"874706","url":"https://devonwiersma.itch.io/bombing-a-graffiti-sandbox"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1527520","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527520"}]},{"igdb_id":144962,"name":"Boxocost","summary":"Boxocost is a multiplayer mini game on the theme of online commerce.","genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Admiral Games"],"publishers":["Admiral Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1616457600,"platforms":["Web browser","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2vy6.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1427685657","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Boxocost"}]},{"igdb_id":144982,"name":"Boom Karts: Multiplayer Kart Racing","summary":"Boom Karts is a free-to-play online kart racing game where speed is the goal!

It is a \"falling blocks\" puzzle game based on the Bomberman franchise. The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects. You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent's field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.\n\nThe game's regular story mode revolves around Bomberman's hunt for the Golden Bomber statue. During his trek, he fights against several different odd characters, like Drifty the balloon, or Cecil the tiger. However, all that can really be earned from playing through this mode is a harder difficulty level, earned by finishing the entire story at the \"hard\" difficulty level.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Raizing"],"publishers":["Hudson Soft","Eighting"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":790387200,"platforms":["Neo Geo AES","Neo Geo MVS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4oax.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":198032,"name":"Bomberman 3D","summary":"Bomberman 3D or 3D Bomberman, is an action 3D game released for mobile phones.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Matrix Software"],"publishers":["Hudson Soft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1102032000,"platforms":["Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5u61.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"637022108","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bomberman%203D"}]},{"igdb_id":198033,"name":"Bomberman","summary":"Bomberman is a free multiplayer game for mobile phones (iOS and Android) available in the Google Play Store, developed and published by Konami, exclusively in Japan.

You can deploy your troops like trench battles but also manage money like classic RTS games. The gameplay is styled to play like ww2 and ww3 strategy games with trench warfare like mechanics.\nFight on the borders of your country in a battle simulator of infantry units. Or command missions in the forests and fields of your country with trench defense. You must protect your home from the enemy in battles that take place in the harsh weather of the desert and finally you must command your troops in tank games where large tank battles take place in the city.\nThe goal of each mission in the military games is to destroy the enemy base or survive until reinforcements arrive. To win you will need to manage your money carefully and perform strategic advancement to win all the campaign missions. Mini warriors can be called to the battlefield by pressing their button from the soldier panel. Money is earned by killing enemy soldiers. Make careful use of tanks and artillery to win the battlefield. At the end you will have to fight the enemy general and defeat him by destroying the boss tank.\nA lot of work and effort was put in developing this project so that it can be enjoyed and played like classic ww2 games and modern ww3 games combined.

The white marks passing below are target markers (flares released at lower level by target marking aircraft. You must maneuver your aircraft so that markers are in the centre of your site when the bombs you have released detonate. This involves accounting for your present height (1-6), so that the bombs will explode with the most markers within the blast range (the red area in centre of your targeting site) when the bombs hit the ground. Therefore, at higher heights you must release your bombs sooner, since it takes more time for them to fall, so that they will hit the ground when the target markers are in the centre of your site. If you completely miss (fail to have any markers within the blast area) you lose a point, if you only have one marker in the blast area no points are lost or gained. You must have at least two markers in the area to begin to gain points. A total score is reported at the end of your bomb run.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":["BASIC 10Liner"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1708041600,"platforms":["TRS-80"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9v7f.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1131892534","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bombaim"},{"category":30,"store":"itch","uid":"2532710","url":"https://bunsen.itch.io/bombaim-tandy-trs-80-mc10-by-jim-gerrie"}]},{"igdb_id":289288,"name":"Bombing","summary":"Play the role of aliens, invade Earth, plunder resources, and eliminate survivors.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7uai.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2800380","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800380"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1090928511","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bombing"}]},{"igdb_id":289404,"name":"Bob The Astronaut","summary":"Meet Bob, the inept astronaut with a heart of gold and a brain of space dust.Stranded on a random planet, Bob must rely on his laser-grapple guns to leave this planet.

Bombo's simple yet challenging mechanics, combined with its time-limited power-ups and bonus scoring system, create an addictive and engaging experience reminiscent of classic arcade games.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536371200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co91az.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":293339,"name":"Bombox","summary":"Bombox is a fast-paced casual game.

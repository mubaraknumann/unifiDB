The console versions use instrument-shaped game controllers, while the DS version uses either the \"Guitar Grip\" introduced with the Guitar Hero: On Tour series or a new Drum Skin that comes with the game. Like previous games, virtual avatars of Taylor Swift, Adam Levine, and the band No Doubt are presented in the game.\n\nBand Hero received mixed reviews from journalists. Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the \"Top 40\" pop rock hits, while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers. They also contested the cost of the full game, featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5, and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form. A day after the game's release, the band No Doubt sued Activision, citing similar misuse of their avatars as the Kurt Cobain avatar in Guitar Hero 5.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["Neversoft Entertainment","Vicarious Visions","Budcat Creations"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":76.0,"release_date":1257206400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","Xbox 360","Nintendo DS","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8vv0.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"23838","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Band Hero"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"26367","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-26367/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B07L4YRSWF","url":null}]},{"igdb_id":2735,"name":"Balloon Fight","summary":"Balloon Fight was developed and released by Nintendo, being the console port of the Arcade game VS.

The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\n\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely.

One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called \"one of its silver linings\". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010.\n\nBackbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade.

Your village chief has assigned you with the task of preventing this war.\n\nBad Blood is a top-down action game with light role-playing elements. You can not create your own character but have to pick one of the three predefined ones: Varrigg (a strong green mutant who fights with his bare hands), Dekker (a human male armed with a knife) or Jakka (she looks human but can shoot laser beams from her eyes like Cyclops of X-Men fame). The choice you make has only a limited impact on gameplay and storyline.\n\nGameplay consists of exploring the world map, visiting several cities and villages, talking with NPCs, picking up items and new weapons (like shotguns, grenades, Uzis etc.) and lots of real-time combat. Bad Blood lacks character stats and character development. The game has a day-night cycle which influences the amount of monsters on the plains and whether or not you can talk with some NPCs.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Origin Systems"],"publishers":["Origin Systems"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5wre.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11412,"name":"Baseball","summary":"Baseball is a baseball sports game that was created on a PDP-10 mainframe computer at Pomona College in 1971 by student Don Daglow.

The program is documented at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. It was the first interactive Baseball simulation game, allowing players to manage the game as it unfolded.\n\nAt the start of each inning the batter's and pitcher's names were listed, and the player in the field could enter a number to choose whether to pitch to the batter, walk him intentionally, warm up a reliever or change the pitcher. In a later version the options for a pitchout and for a visit to the mound were added. The player controlling the batter could choose to put in a pinch hitter. If runners were on base the player could direct them to try to steal. Once the players had entered the desired orders, the game would print out the result of the at-bat, update the number of outs, the score and the location of the runners, and print the name of the next batter. If a game was still a tie after nine innings, extra innings would be played in accordance with baseball rules.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":62985600,"platforms":["PDP-10"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11677,"name":"Bananoid","summary":"Bananoid is a freeware Arkanoid clone, which runs on a tweaked VGA mode the author likes to call 360x240 MCGA.

The game is notable for engaging the player in brinkmanship.\n\nThe goal of the game is simple: the player may choose to be either the President of the United States or the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and must lead the chosen superpower for eight years, seeking to maximize \"prestige\" and avoiding a nuclear war. Each turn is one year long; at the beginning of each year, the player is presented with a set of incidents and crises in various countries around the globe, and must choose a response to each one. Responses may range from no action, to diplomatic notes to the other superpower, to military maneuvers. Each response is then met with a counter-response, which may vary from backing down to escalation. The player then gets a chance to initiate actions, and deal with the opponent's responses.\n\nThis core mechanic is similar to that of Bruce Ketchledge's 1983 game Geopolitique 1990, published by SSI. One difference from the earlier game is how negotiations are resolved. In both games, backing down in a negotiation results in a loss of prestige, which will reverberate politically. Likewise, in both games brinkmanship may result in a global war. In Geopolitique, such wars were actually fought in-game, after which the game continued. In Balance of Power, such a war ends the game instantly, with the following message: \"You have ignited a nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["Square","Square Enix","Square Product Development Division 6"],"publishers":["Square","Square Enix"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":823824000,"platforms":["Wii","Wii U","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2c6p.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"15117","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15117/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"13866","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bahamut Lagoon"}]},{"igdb_id":15897,"name":"Bakumatsu Kourinden Oni","summary":"Bakumatsu Korinden Oni is a Role-Playing game, developed by Pandora Box and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1996.\n\nThis is the seventh title in the ONI series and is set in Japan approximately 670 years after the previous title, Kishin KouRinden ONI.\nThe two titles share the same world and common characters.\nIt is also notable for the appearance of historical figures such as the Shinsengumi, Ryoma Sakamoto, and Yoshinobu Tokugawa.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Pandora Box"],"publishers":["Banpresto"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":823219200,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4b3k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"13867","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-13867/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"12728","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bakumatsu%20Kourin%20Den%3A%20Oni"}]},{"igdb_id":16126,"name":"Batsugun","summary":"Batsugun is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up video game created by the now-defunct Japanese game developer Toaplan.

Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses.

Utsuro Naru Kamigami no Utsuwa","summary":"Bastard!! is a game based on the popular manga of the same name. You take on the role of Dark Schneider, an evil wizard who parts on a quest to regain back his memory. The gameplay isn’t really deep, you just go from one boss to another. You have tons of magic moves to use in battle and you can even combine them to create devastating spells. One major disadvantage is that the game was only aimed at the readers of the manga, so if you haven’t read the manga, you won’t understand anything of the characters and the background story.\n\nBastard? Destructive God of Darkness is a manga by Kazushi Hagiwara. It first appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump, in 1988, and continues to be published irregularly today in Ultra Jump. Currently, it spans 25 volumes.\n\nIn Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren.\n\nBastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers.\n\nIn the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world.\n\nThe story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society. The episodes are rather disjointed, with scenes missing in between episodes making it hard to follow, but taken at face value it makes enough sense.\n\nManufacturer's description:\n\nHagiwara Hazime solstitial popular comic \"BASTARD!!\" based on an original story developed in RPG. And the battle system with a highly strategic position is reflected in the war situation and the compatibility of the character.

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year. Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form. Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players. Enhanced pitch control. Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams. You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5. Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves.

Unlike the Jinsei Gekijou series however, Ai no Gekijou opts to focus on teenage life and romance in particular, rather than the wider scope seen in other life-simulation titles.","genres":["Simulator","Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":["Coconuts Japan"],"publishers":["Coconuts Japan"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662428800,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co73zq.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"15687","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15687/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"14381","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bakushou!!%20Ai%20no%20Gekijou"}]},{"igdb_id":48730,"name":"Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In","summary":"Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In is a Sports game, developed by Graphic Research and published by K Amusement Leasing, which was released in Japan in 1990.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Graphic Research"],"publishers":["K Amusement Leasing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":643593600,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co73zn.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1984656926","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Baken%20Hisshou%20Gaku%3A%20Gate%20In"}]},{"igdb_id":48924,"name":"Battletoads in Ragnarok's World","summary":"In 1993, a Game Boy version of Battletoads was released, titled \"Battletoads in Ragnarok's World\".

Players not only control the combat units (ranging from infantry and tanks to helicopters, fighters and bombers, armored trains, surface warships and submarines, stationary gun turrets), but (especially in the later games) also many support logistics units (ammo and fuel transports, scout and radar units, road and construction vehicles, and others). Units have various weapons and can gain experience (which in later games can be transferred over in a campaign). Fuel and ammo is limited, and logistics require careful attention. Players also control buildings, where units can be repaired, and sometimes, produced. Weather conditions change, affecting unit movements (for example, a sea or river can freeze, immobilizing ships but allowing light units to move through it). Fog of war is prevalent and players have to use scouting units to gain information about the battlefield. Some of those options were added in expansions or sequels. \n \nPlayers have various tasks, ranging from eliminating all opponent forces to capturing specific buildings or protecting certain units or places. In some missions events from outside the battlefield can suddenly change the situation, giving players new objectives, reinforcements, allies or enemies. In some battles there are more than two sides, each with their own objectives, not all of them directly involved in hostilities - some of them can be even allied. At the same time, those allegiances can change because of some events or actions. \n \nBattle Isle one had the screen divided into two parts, one for each player. The turns were also divided into move and attack phases. While one player moved his units, the other commanded his own troops to carry out his actions. Battle Isle 2 gave the player the entire screen, and merged move and attack phases, and introduced the 3-D display of combat. Battle Isle 3 was very similar to Battle Isle 2, with improved graphics, more units and a new storyline. Battle Isle: The Andosian War was entirely set in the 3-D environment and combined elements of real-time and turn-based strategies. \n \nThe AI is relatively weak, relying on mass frontal assaults. After a player survives the first few turns and the AI's overwhelming numbers using protected artillery and terrain advantage, the computer is usually unable to mount a proper defense.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":975628800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"785920130","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Battle%20Isle%20IV%3A%20The%20Andosia%20War"}]},{"igdb_id":50499,"name":"Balance of the Planet","summary":"Balance of the Planet is an environmental management simulation.\n\nIt is the successor to Balance of Power.\n\nChris Crawford seems to have a special liking for problems of global concern. Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first \"ecosim\", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject.\n\nSim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems.\n\nContrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success.\n\nBalance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load \"biased\" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":633830400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5xjn.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"1134","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-1134/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1038","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Balance%20of%20the%20Planet"}]},{"igdb_id":50531,"name":"BattleBit Remastered","summary":"BattleBit Remastered is a low-poly, massive multiplayer FPS, supporting 254 players per server.

Each unit has its own unique ability that you need to take advantage of in order to win each battle.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["HexWar Games"],"publishers":["HexWar Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1431216000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22zf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":67666,"name":"Basted","summary":"Two young and lovely bounty huntresses, Ryeza and Anita, live in a village that is continuously attacked by monsters. One day, solving a little monster problem in the nearby forest, they encounter a mysterious masked man, who tells Ryeza she wields the power of the sacred jewel Basted. Soon the two girls join forces with a princess in exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its allies.\n\nThough Basted may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that alternates between towns and dungeons, etc.), it is in fact primarily an action game. Controlling Ryeza and Anita, the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.\n\nMost battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.\n\nThe game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["JTS"],"publishers":["NEC Avenue"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":782697600,"platforms":["Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5249.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":67699,"name":"Balloon Rescue","summary":"Balloon Rescue is a simply dexterity game for the C64, released in 1983 by Alligata Software Ltd.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eenpd6qrz7fgdjm7lio5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":67705,"name":"Bamboo Blade: Sorekara no Chousen","summary":"Bamboo Blade: Sorekara no Chousen is a card-based strategy game based on the anime Bamboo Blade.

Star Monomane Shiten-ou is a Nintendo Family Computer life simulation video game that portrays the life of either a musician or a famous performer of the monomane style of Japanese theatre. The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert.\n\nAppeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.\n\nIn the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert.\n\nWhen the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects.\n\nThe dice combination \"A-1\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \"F-5\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Pack-In-Video"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":653270400,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q7wlgsotqk7srcbnuat1.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2017","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Bakushou%21%20Star%20Monomane%20Shiten-ou"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"2207","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-2207/"}]},{"igdb_id":71125,"name":"BattleSphere","summary":"A space-sim/shooter that was developed and released after the demise of its host console, the Atari Jaguar.

In some modes holding or defending a flag is the primary goal, where in others it is simply to obtain the most frags. For all game modes, the basic objective is to kill enemy players. Before spawning, the player is presented with a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. A few grenades and a molotov cocktail are also supplied by default and more grenades can be picked up from the ground. Some servers enable secondary functions like knives, shields or nuclear kamikaze attacks. Upon death players leave behind a health pack for healing injury, the weapon and any equipped grenades for others to pick up. After waiting for a server-specified amount of time (usually less than five seconds), players respawn and may choose another weapon—this cycle repeats for the duration of the map.

In the last two scenes, you have to use elevators to get from Point A to Point B. Be warned: you can only carry one money bag at a time, and the weight of the bag makes you move slowly, making it a lot easier for miners to catch you. Also remember that time is against you, but if you manage to dump a bag in the wheelbarrow, you are given more time. There is a special money bag (worth more points) inside a blocked off room, in the middle screen.

The DLC brought no new factions to the game, but introduced a new game mode titled \"Air Assault\" in the remaining two maps. These two maps, both only plane- and zeppelin-focused, are named \"Razor's Edge\" and \"London Calling.\" While both maps feature combat above detailed landscapes (Razor's Edge taking place in the Alps and London Calling occurring over the city of London), neither are based on factual battles. Apocalypse brought new weapons and gadgets to Battlefield 1 as well. The weapons released include the RSC SMG, Howell Automatic, lMG 08/18, Ross MkIII, M1917 Enfield, and Webley Revolver Mk VI. In addition, melee weapons including the Broken Bottle, Wine Bottle, Meat Cleaver, and Prybar were introduced to the game.

On December 15, 2003, Taito released an updated System 246 version named Battle Gear 3 Tuned and featuring seven extra cars including the Mazda RX-8 Type-S (SE3P) and the Nissan 350Z (Z33). Also, four new tracks (the B courses) including a secret one, were added, as well as an exclusive \"Takumi Mode\". The Takumi Mode gives the player a finishing time/reduced speed penalty each time the car hits a wall. The purpose of this feature is to offer a more realistic and artistic driving experience dixit the developer himself. This principle was used one year later by Polyphony Digital in Gran Turismo 4. By Christmas of the same year, Nextech Entertainment ported Battle Gear 3 to the PlayStation 2 with an opening CG movie, an exclusive \"Event Race\" online contest mode and some extras from the updated version, consisting of four cars (D-Class) and two courses (B). The Battle Gear (BG) franchise has a popular following in Asia due to the continuation of the Side by Side arcade and PlayStation 1990s series. In late 2002, a PAL version of Battle Gear 2 was licensed by Midas Interactive and published as Tokyo Road Race in Europe and Oceania. Both \"Net Ranking\" and \"Network\" modes were removed though. By July 2005, Battle Gear 4 was launched in Japan on Taito's latest 2.5 GHz CPU based Type X+ system board. This new episode introduced official tuned cars such as the Nismo Fairlady S-Tune Z33, Nismo Skyline S-Tune R34 or the Apexi RX-7 FD3S (D1GP'05 version), and even licensed European makers for the very first time.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1036108800,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6vdo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":91922,"name":"Battle High School","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":91981,"name":"Backgammon NJ HD","summary":"Backgammon NJ HD is a full-featured game which uses an advanced, neural network-based, artificial intelligence.

Initially, the player has a small bakery and the amount of cash to dispose.\n\nAnd with time, along with the development of his bakery, taking care of acquiring new customers and expanding his stores, the player gains new opportunities. In the future, the player will be able to expand his company with new and larger bakeries, which will significantly increase production possibilities. And by introducing new products to its offer, it can increase revenues in such stores and thus increase its profits. The player also has marketing campaigns at his disposal, which can significantly affect the number of customers in the player's stores. The number of customers and by the volume of sales can also be influenced by high-quality products, thanks to which the player can win occasional bakery festivals that take place from time to time.\n\nAnd with such a strong position, the player can conquer new markets in other cities, creating their warehouses and new stores there. On the other hand, however, the player has full freedom in action. It can focus on the production of the cheapest products and reach as many customers as possible.\n\nThe game itself is designed so that in each of the \"modules\" I can add functions and add depth to game features. And so far, the game does not yet contain all the functions and mechanics that I would like to see in this game. But mainly add depth to the production mechanics about production lines. Whether as part of the purchase of \"technology\" or building your own production line. I also think a lot about the introduction of the logistics module. It would be naturally connected to the warehouse. This would allow the introduction of delivery elements to the game. Purchase of delivery vehicles and possible plans for the supply stores. And that would probably be my biggest ideas for adding content. In the meantime, I will want to add new minor functions and improvements like a bank and other smaller features whcih will balance gameplay.\n\nA Few Words From the Author\nBy creating Bakery Biz Tycoon, my main goal was to create a title that will relate to old school tycoon games. In which the player has to focus more on the macro of managing the enterprise than on micro-management or time management. I tried to create a more complex production than typical Time Management games, but simple enough for the time spent with Bakery Biz Tycoon to be fun. And I wish all this and I hope that my first game will give you at least a few hours of pleasant gameplay.

Drawings tell part of the game's story on the walls. The drawings have no defined authorship, which gives them an extra degree of strangeness. The second point is the existence of The Guide, a being that instigates the players to think about their actions in real life.\n\nThe game basically has one objective throughout its 40-level journey: place the red box over the red button and open the door to the next level. It seems simple at first, but it's not. Each environment has its own logic. If the players feel frustrated because something went wrong in their strategy, they can press the “wake up again\" button, which will return them to the beginning of the level.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["White Vortex"],"publishers":["White Vortex"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1657238400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4wzo.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"126264554","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Backroom%20Beyond"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2062820","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062820"},{"category":30,"store":"itch","uid":"1580292","url":"https://whitevortex.itch.io/backroom-beyond"}]},{"igdb_id":206684,"name":"Bassmaster Fishing 2022: Super Deluxe Edition","summary":"Experience the thrill of competitive big bass fishing and climb the ranks to become the Bassmaster Classic champion!","genres":["Simulator","Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1655942400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5q5g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":206727,"name":"Backstage","summary":"A point-and-click search for clues behind the curtains.

One of the countries, Kradion, is largely frozen. Its people are famous for their mercenary soldiers and mechanical fighters. The other country, Welfrad, is prosperous and fertile. Kradion depends on imported food. When the great famine struck there was no food available and times were hard, so Kradion attacked Welfrad, all but destroying Welfrad's royal knight units. Just a few ace units survived because they were not in the capital when the attack came.\n\nAmong these is Ryuke, aka Blue Wing, chief knight of the royal army, who pilots the elemental fighter Huben Drake. The game starts with Ryuke separated from surviving units. He must survive and join his comrades to wage guerrilla war on the enemy.\n\nThe game consists of large-scale tactical battles, which are played on an isometrically viewed map, only part of which can be seen at once.

The Backrooms are a surreal and unsettling place, filled with strange noises, flickering lights, and mysterious creatures that seem to be watching you from the shadows.\n\nAs you explore the Backrooms, you'll need to find keys, solve puzzles, and avoid dangerous traps and obstacles. You'll also encounter other lost souls who are trying to escape, but not all of them can be trusted. The deeper you go, the more unsettling the Backrooms become, and the harder it is to tell what's real and what's just a figment of your imagination.\n\nBackrooms: Realm of Shadows is designed to be a tense and atmospheric horror experience, with a focus on exploration, puzzle-solving, and survival. It's a game that will keep you on edge from start to finish, as you try to find your way out of this terrifying and otherworldly place.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Cyprus Games"],"publishers":["Cyprus Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1689033600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6kiq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":247604,"name":"BananaGuy","summary":"BananGuy returns for a new epic adventure!

Tanks could also teleport to any spot on the map, lay down mines as traps for enemy tanks, and use a radar to detect hidden enemy mines and pickups.\n\nFuel played the role of the tank's health, and it was consumed by moving, teleporting, shooting, using a radar, laying mines, or getting shot by enemies. Upon running out of fuel the tank was deactivated and the player had to wait to respawn. It could be replenished by collecting fuel canisters. Equipment could also be acquired; this included better weapons, protective shields, and a long-range radar. Other map features included obstacles which could be moved around by the tank, and ferries used for transport over water.\n\nThe game was originally available on the game website Bonus.com, but became defunct when the website closed in 2004.

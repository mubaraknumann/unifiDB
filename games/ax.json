The basic stats of the player's mech, e.g. armor or the boost speed, are determined by the chosen pilot character and the used mech components which can be changed for arms, legs, chassis, head, booster and weapon load-out. All those components have strengths, weaknesses and weight, the latter being the restricting factor. \n \nThe game also has a single-player mode, skirmish, which consists of playing multiplayer matches against bots.

Race on 8 different short tracks designed by offroad pros in 15 different high-powered 4x4's, for 3 different championships. The races are long, the competition is fast, and the outlook is grim. All you got is your skills and unerring faith in your machine. Are you ready for Larry Ragland's 4x4 Challenge?\n\nLarry Ragland's 4x4 Challenge (LRC from now on) is basically an arcade racer in a short-track offroad setting. Usually set inside a stadium or such, it features some unknown-make vehicles (no adjustments allowed) each with slightly different ratings in handlings, acceleration, and more. The courses are very reminiscent of the ones in LEADFOOT (by Ratbag Interactive).\n\nThe tracks are your typical supercross type-tracks... Lots of curves, jumps, and a few straights with switchbacks and more switchbacks. The tracks are different enough as some are longer with higher speed whereas some are low-speed with lots of switchbacks.\n\nYou get an arcade mode where you're supposed to keep up with the clock, or you can play the championship, where you race a field of 5 other AI drivers across a series of events on the various tracks. When you win one championship, you unlock the next one, which is longer and features a couple new tracks. There are a total of 3 championships across 8 different tracks, up to 6 laps each.\n\nThe vehicles in LRC are pretty tough, but they are NOT indestructible. This game actually models damage to your vehicle. There are four components you can damage: front tires/suspension, engine, transmission, and rear tires/suspension. The usual cause for damage is smacking into walls too hard, though hard collisions with another vehicle will do damage. Damaged cars don't run quite as fast and generates black smoke. The parts go from green to yellow to red, and if you're really bad... black.\n\nMultiplayer is only supported as 2-player split-screen, or 6-player LAN. Internet play is not supported.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Katana Games"],"publishers":["Noviy Disk","Xicat Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1008374400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":332638,"name":"Lady Bug Arcade","summary":"It's dinnertime and Lady Bug is hungry!

Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move. Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve. When the score of 999,999 is reached, the digits in the score turn to exclamation points, and the game ends.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Activision"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":378604800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9iuu.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":81132,"name":"Last Berserker: Endless War","summary":"Kill or Die!

Experience a story-driven campaign! Fight for your Sanity and defeat the Lovecraftian horrors.\n\nLast Spartan sees you playing as the titular Last Spartan as you battle through a story-driven randomly generated campaign where keeping a grip on your waning sanity becomes increasingly difficult as you do battle with more and more enemies that draw inspiration from Greek mythology and the Lovecraft mythos.\n\nIt's a roguelike with deck-building elements. The unique part here is that your deck is actually a set of customisable dices, with each face acting as a slot for a different ability. There are over 700+ dice faces to discover, allowing you to develop and learn numerous synergies to suit your preferred playstyle, especially when god selection comes into play.\n\nAside from the dice, you will be accompanied on each run by an ally Greek god. There are over 10 of them currently, although they won't all be unlocked immediately, and each provides distinct active and passive abilities. With them, you can develop different strategies for dealing with the many foes you encounter.\n\nAccording to the developer, for the first ten hours, you will face new enemies on every run, with over 100 regular enemies and 20-plus mini-bosses to discover and fight in turn-based combat. This should keep the game feeling fresh and surprising for far longer than other entries in the genre.\n\nThe same applies to encounters with over 200 NPCs to meet and choices surrounding them to make. Depending on your interaction, they might provide you with a reward, blessings, or even curses that will remain constant until the end of that particular run.\n\nSome of those NPCs will make their way to your city. It's here where you respawn after dying and spend resources you've gathered throughout each run to upgrade the various buildings in a bid to rebuild Sparta. This is the more permanent side of the Last Spartan game and will eventually provide you with perks that increase your chance of completing a run and progressing the overarching story.\n\nThe indie game Last Spartan is set to come out in early access on PC/Mac/Linux via Steam in February-March 2024 and full release coming to all Platforms and major storefronts by April 2024 ( Coming to PC/Mac/Linux first and then to all major consoles like Xbox & Playstation & Nintendo Switch & IOS soon after PC and console release )","genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Tactical","Indie","Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","PlayStation 5","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7boc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":336142,"name":"Lamentum: Digital Deluxe","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9k0s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":333277,"name":"Last Report","summary":"Last Report is a dark horror game where you play as a night shift park ranger.

It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.\n\nL.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.\n\nThe game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.","genres":["Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Team Bondi","Rockstar Leeds","Rockstar North"],"publishers":["Take-Two Interactive","Rockstar Games"],"aggregated_rating":89.375,"release_date":1305590400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","SteamVR","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ldn.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"229788","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/229788"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"B075YX2NJ6","url":null},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"B075N32S46","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B075N32S46"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025454086c","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/LA-Noire/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025454086c"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"21500","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-21500/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"19589","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/L.A.

Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's \"flag.\"\n\nPRODUCTION HISTORY\nThis wargame simulation took a long time in programming (officially 391 days, compared to 170 days for Night Stalker, begun at about the same time); when completed in mid-1982, Marketing was concerned that its design already looked dated.\n\nA second concern was that, due to the complexity of the game, it required more memory than an Intellivision contained; the cartridge would have to include 256 bytes of RAM onboard. Only USCF Chess had been approved for onboard RAM, an expensive proposition.\n\nWhen the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) was given the green light, Gabriel Baum, VP of Applications Software, proposed changing Land Battle to an ECS title; the ECS had an additional 2K of RAM available for cartridges. Marketing resisted this -- they still wanted Land Battle as a stand-alone game. Peggi Decarli was assigned to give the game a graphics makeover.\n\nAfter the makeover, Marketing still didn't find it visually interesting enough. By that time, wargame fanatic Steve Sents, having completed Deadly Discs, had started work on an ECS wargame called Desert Fox, which Marketing liked the looks of better. The decision was made to kill Land Battle and incorporate as much of its gameplay and programming as possible into the Desert Fox design.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Mattel"],"publishers":["Mattel"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":917740800,"platforms":["Intellivision"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ph2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":93533,"name":"Lagnacure Legend","summary":"Sequel to Lagnacure, Lagnacure Legend takes place fifteen years after the first game's events, continuing on with the son of the main character from the first game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Artdink"],"publishers":["Artdink"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":960336000,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co52ps.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":76463,"name":"Larry Vales II: Dead Girls are Easy","summary":null,"genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":235994,"name":"Last Order","summary":"Last Order is a 2D action game with pixel art style.

Noire: The Complete Edition","summary":"L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.\n\nL.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.\n\nIn addition to the original full game, L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition for PC will include a multi-use code to access all the previously released downloadable content from the console versions, including the “Nicholson Electroplating” Arson case, the “Reefer Madness” Vice case, “The Consul’s Car” Traffic case, “The Naked City” Vice case and “A Slip of the Tongue” Traffic case.","genres":["Shooter","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Rockstar Leeds","Team Bondi"],"publishers":["Rockstar Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1320710400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ldm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":309994,"name":"Last Chance for Turnabout","summary":"A cold case, a suicide, and a murder intersect.

The player takes control of Aarzak (Kenshiro in the Japanese original), who fights against his enemies using his punches and kicks. Aarzak can attack while standing, jumping, and crouching, for a total of six basic attacks. In addition to his life gauge, Aarzak has a power-up meter that will gradually fill as he defeats enemies. When the meter reaches a certain point (depending on the stage), Aarzak will transform into a super-powered state, allowing him to perform rapid punches and kicks for the rest of the stage. The game's levels (with the exception of boss battles and maze stages) feature a time limit at the lower-right corner of the screen; but unlike other time limits, instead of killing the character immediately when it reaches, it will instead gradually drain the player's life gauge until the player completes the level.\n\nThe game is divided into four stages or chapters, each featuring several levels. After completing a level the player will be shown a map which displays the player's current location and the paths they can take. Most of the levels are linear side-scrolling segments where the player must simply walk from one to side to the other while fighting every enemy who gets in the way. Other levels are dungeon mazes in which the player must figure out the correct path to the goal while avoiding traps. The player will encounter various allies throughout the game that will increase Aarzak's offensive or defensive strength, or replenish their health. The game features several one-on-one encounters with bosses as well. The player must sometime complete levels in a certain order in order to finish a chapter.\n\n'Last Battle' is also notorious amongst gamers for its harsh difficulty throughout.\n\nThe original Japanese version is based on the Fist of the North Star mangas/animes. During the translation process all references to Fist of the North Star were removed - similar to its predecessor Black Belt.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"publishers":["Elite Systems","Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":619056000,"platforms":["Arcade","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5ntj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":301818,"name":"Ladder Climbing","summary":"The little monsters are trapped here, you have to find a way out...Be careful of the traps on the road, replenish nutrients in time, and don't give these disobedient little monsters a chance to lose their temper!!!","genres":["Strategy","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1716681600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co889h.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":148648,"name":"Land of Heroes","summary":"Fight fearless monsters, improve your skills, gather allies and explore a whole new fantasy world","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Vibestro"],"publishers":["Vibestro"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1611964800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co92zl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":199511,"name":"Lab","summary":"Deep underground in an old laboratory, an animal wakes up.

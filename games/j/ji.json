Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because slot machines were originally operated by a lever on the side of the machine (the one arm) instead of a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the gamer penniless. Many modern machines still have a legacy lever in addition to the button.\n\nSlot machines include a currency detector that validates the coin or money inserted to play. The machine pays off based on patterns of symbols visible on the front of the machine when it stops. Modern computer technology has resulted in many variations on the slot machine concept. Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and constitute about 70 percent of the average casino's income. It is estimated that thirty percent or more of the profits from gambling machines come from problem gamblers.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Sammy"],"publishers":["Sammy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":898732800,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob45o.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":238309,"name":"Jigsaw Masterpieces: Cats and Friends on the Suetoshi Farm / Kenta Igarashi","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1620864000,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":82307,"name":"Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou!

Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read \"Get on with it!\" and such. \n \nThe game was followed by Archer MacLean's Pool in 1992 and Jimmy White's 2: Cueball in 1999.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eerk3ql3wm9e6ukguvbl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79817,"name":"Jillian Michaels' Fitness Ultimatum 2010","summary":"Jillian Michaels' workout game for 2010 was released on the Wii and DS in October 2009.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Majesco Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1254787200,"platforms":["Wii","Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co74mp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":126388,"name":"Jingjie","summary":"Dice&Fighter is a console game with elements such as RPG, AVG, SLG, CCG, etc. In accordance with it's turn-based battle mode, 1v1 dicing is the only thing you need to do.

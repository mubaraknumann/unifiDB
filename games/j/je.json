The gameplay of Jet Set Radio differs in several key areas from its Dreamcast counterpart. Instead of being a 3D game using polygons, the game is a 2D game with an isometric viewpoint. The goal of the game is to traverse through neighborhoods and find key locations to tag them with graffiti under a specific time frame. Players can grind on rails and perform tricks. When a key location is reached, players must tag it with graffiti that may require a single press of a button, or a sequence of buttons that need to be pressed at the correct time. The game offers a graffiti editor to customize and create unique graffiti tags. Players can collect hidden icons scattered throughout in order to expand the number of graffiti tags. After completing the story mode of a specific neighborhood, three new time attack modes are unlocked for that neighborhood. The three modes involve tagging an entire city, racing, and performing tricks. Jet Grind Radio also offers 4-player multiplayer that allows players to compete within the unlocked time attack modes.","genres":["Music","Platform"],"developers":["Vicarious Visions"],"publishers":["THQ","Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":76.0,"release_date":1056585600,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3rje.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":8954,"name":"Jets'n'Guns","summary":"You take the role of a freelance pilot who has to save the Universe from evil warlord Xoxx, who has stolen a gigantic space gun with the power to destroy the entire Universe.

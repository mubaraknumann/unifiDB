[{"igdb_id":220865,"name":"J.League Jikkyou Winning Eleven 3","summary":"The third installment in the J. League Jikkyou football/soccer series. As with the other games in the series, the game focuses entirely on Japanese soccer leagues and lets you choose a team and try your luck at various available cups, quick exhibition matches or leagues. All the expected gameplay elements of a soccer game are there, from various player moves and rules of the game to setting team formations and choosing teams to control and stadiums to play on. Live commentator is present, but doesn't comment on everything but only on key elements as well as addressing players by their actual names. Camera isn't fixed and adjusts during gameplay to best show the current action, switches to back view for free kicks and penalties, zooms out if the ball is too high to show both the kicker and the ball, and otherwise works as an action camera slightly rotating angles and using zoom automatically instead of just scrolling over the soccer field. Before engaging in a match with another player or the CPU, player can also do training with a selected team where only your team players are on the field where one can test all the moves and learn the ropes. Penalty kicks are also available for practice, but it includes two teams aiming to score five goals first.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":910828800,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co96ah.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":181567,"name":"J.League Jikkyou Winning Eleven 97","summary":"J.League Jikkyou Winning Eleven '97 (or World Soccer Winning Eleven 2) is a 1996 Japan-exclusive soccer simulation video game, which was developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":848620800,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co48m3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":3521,"name":"J.League Live 64","summary":"J.League Live 64 is a soccer game for the Nintendo 64.

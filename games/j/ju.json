Each visit is in two parts, for example visiting Granny in the frozen north starts with a request to click on all the items beginning with a specific letter to defrost them. There's usually around half a dozen items on the ground of which four match the specified criteria. Once this task has been completed the pupil goes to an ice hockey practice session. Here a letter is shown on the scoreboard and hockey pucks with three and four letter words are slid over the ice. If the initial letter of the word matches the target letter the pupil clicks on the puck and, if they're right, it's fired into the net. If the initial letter does not match the target letter they click on the referee and the puck melts away. After completing the mini games the player is shown a clue to the carrot patch treasure, this specifies a letter. The player is then taken to the carrot patch where they must identify the letter from those shown, they click on it, a tunnel is dug to that spot where there will be an object and a small animation. Different games stress different reading elements.

Using lost technology found within Sagoth's ruins, and supplies left across the planet, he's created a robotic army superior to anything the federation can muster. You're going alone, using a bipedal mech based on what little of Geisel's research has been intercepted. It's time to reclaim your lost bases, eliminate the scientist's legions, and uncover the secrets lying beneath this world.\n\nJuushin ROGUS combines turn-based strategy, side-scrolling shooter action, and a light RPG layer into one accessible story. Managing and moving between your military bases, which automatically produce new units you can distribute, is crucial to success. Defending or attacking a base leads to action-platforming combat, where you jump, shoot, and fly across a battlefield full of limited replenishing enemies. As you destroy foes, your mech levels up over time, acquiring new weapons, aerial boosters, and even pilot bodyguards later on. To win, you must claim the final base and defeat Geisel in his lair—but it won't be easy.","genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Artec"],"publishers":["Random House"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567993600,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co62ur.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":81657,"name":"Jump to the circle","summary":"\"Jump to the circle\" is a pretty casual game where is a good balance between challenging gameplay and funny gameplay.","genres":["Music","Indie"],"developers":["Dexion Games"],"publishers":["Dexion Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1518220800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7ps3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":200838,"name":"Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack","summary":"Showcase an array of outstanding new prehistoric species with the Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1646697600,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qqo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":340781,"name":"Jungle Jim","summary":"An action/adventure 2D platformer game focus on exploration","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1731974400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ow9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":25249,"name":"Juggernaut","summary":"Juggernaut takes the player on a bizarre journey dealing with demonic possession and the power of evil.

It is based on the long-running comic book series, (as opposed to other recent Justice League games which are adaptations of other media besides the source material) and was written by veteran comic book and Justice League of America writer Dwayne McDuffie. It uses the Dark Alliance Engine.\n\nTwo handheld Justice League Heroes games were released at the same time for the GBA and Nintendo DS systems.

It was replaced by JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade in 2002.\n\nLike the previous JumpStart products, the game takes place in a school setting, but begins after school hours when a giant anthropomorphic frog named C.J. enters the classroom and frees a firefly named Edison. C.J. and Edison (Newton in the United Kingdom) form a double act of sorts with C.J. being an ardent, self-styled \"adventurer\" while Edison is the more pragmatic straight man, who frequently makes sardonic comments in response to C.J.'s grandiosity. The duo have appeared in many other JumpStart products, such as JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade; however, their looks and personalities have both undergone enormous changes throughout the years.","genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Knowledge Adventure"],"publishers":["Knowledge Adventure","Levande Böcker"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":826848000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4trf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":311898,"name":"Jurassic Knights: Tactics","summary":"Jurassic Knights: Tactics is a turn-based tactical RPG.

Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first “Haunted House Simulator” where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory.

The team was motivated to do a game around this funny monkey. \n \nOn February 02, 1989, the first prototype was ready: one level, no enemies, no musics and the monkey can jump only (no shoot). At this point, they decided to reprogram the game entirely from 0. Note JuJu Densetsu was coded with the same system used by the neogeo coders at SNK. \n \nDuring the first location test (at the TAD office) on September 07, 1989, many new ideas came to the developers but most of them were not included in the final product (i.e: snakes on the first stage), because lack of time. \n \nOn September 15, 1989. a public location test was done in Japan AND in the USA (University of Washington). A second test was done in October. After this test, they decided to program the end of the game (done by a non-programmer in a week-end). Note: The girl you have to save is brune in the attract mode and blonde at the end. \n \nThe game was finished on November 06, 1989. \n \nThen, after about 10 months of development, JuJu Densetsu was finally released on December 08, 1989 in Japan by TAD. 3148 arcade boards were sold. Export releases: \"Toki\". \n \nThe title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of JuJu'. \n \nThe devil monkey with horns from the level 2 is called Bellzador (Dev. code name: Akuma Zaru) and has the most complex AI routine. It takes 27 pages 'A4' format in the source code. Its desing and patern were inspired by Red Arremer from Makaimura. \n \nThere is some unused sprites for the character's animation in the game code. \n \nOn February 26, 1990, TAD know that pirate versions of their game appear on the market. \n \nThis was the last video game developed by TAD. A sequel was planned (JuJu 2! an action puzzle game) for the Super Famicom but the company closed its door 2 months after the JuJu Desnsetsu release.

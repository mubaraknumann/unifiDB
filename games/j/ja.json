Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.\n\nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers.\n\nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die. Levant (the original title's protagonist) is now a guardian and acts as your guide.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Genki"],"publishers":["Ubi Soft Entertainment","Genki"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":999129600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ni9.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"11572","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-11572/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10617","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Jade Cocoon 2"}]},{"igdb_id":18101,"name":"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf","summary":"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf is a golf-simulation video game developed by Sculptured Software, and published by Accolade in 1988.\nThe game features simulations of eighteen holes from renowned golf courses in the United States, Scotland, and England: Four from Augusta National Golf Club, three from Pebble Beach Golf Links, three from the Old Course at St Andrews, two from the Riviera Country Club, two from Baltusrol Golf Club, one from Oakmont Country Club, one from Merion Golf Club, one from Muirfield, and one from Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club.

If a die is on a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with another die of the same color, both those dice and every die in-between will drop by one in value. Once a die has reached \"1\" and is involved in another combo, it disappears. Dice on top fall in the gaps left behind, potentially creating chain reactions.

Janken Disk Shiro is a block-pushing puzzle game based on the playground game Janken (Rock, Paper, Scissors).\n\nJanken Disk Shiro, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 Janken Disk Shiro, is a puzzle game in which the protagonist (who looks uncannily like Disk-kun, the mascot of the Famicom Disk System) must brave a labyrinth of puzzles. In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the \"scissors\" gesture, the \"rock\" gesture or the \"paper\" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a \"strength\" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).\n\nGameplay revolves around finding the right blocks to push together to clear a way to the exit. Not every block needs to be eliminated: just those that are direct obstacles between the player and the end of the stage.\n\nThe game adopts a familiar veneer of the typical 8-bit fantasy RPG: The player starts in a small town in which they can talk to NPCs and purchase power-ups, they can visit the King in his castle to begin their quest and they can visit the dungeons in which the puzzles are found (after receiving permission from the King).\n\nJanken Disk Shiro has the distinction of being the very last game ever produced for the Famicom Disk System. The peripheral had been effectively retired by the 90s due to advancements in NES cart technology.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":724982400,"platforms":["Family Computer Disk System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xz8tczcgqp1shh7vedtn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":41671,"name":"Jackie Chan in The Police Story","summary":"Chan Ka-Kui is Hong Kong's supercop, and he is going after the evil underground gang to take them down once and for all.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":518140800,"platforms":["MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6sdl.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"67919","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-67919/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"505441","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Jackie%20Chan%20in%20The%20Police%20Story"}]},{"igdb_id":41672,"name":"Jackie Chan no Spartan X","summary":"Help Jackie and Yuen save Sylvia from her evil uncle!","genres":["Racing","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":491702400,"platforms":["MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9e0q.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"107108","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Jackie%20Chan%20no%20Spartan%20X"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"41200","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-41200/"}]},{"igdb_id":41673,"name":"Jackie Chan in The Protector","summary":"Protector, martial arts specialist in service of the NYPD, tracks fown a ruthless drugs syndicate that has kidnapped his girl.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":491702400,"platforms":["MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6sdk.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1320168629","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Jackie%20Chan%20in%20The%20Protector"}]},{"igdb_id":41674,"name":"Jackie Chan in Project A","summary":"The seas of Hong Kong have been infested with pirates, and Ma leads his squad to stop the swashbucklers once and for all.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Pony Canyon"],"publishers":["Pony Canyon"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":450144000,"platforms":["MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6sdj.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"67914","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-67914/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"505446","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Jackie%20Chan%20in%20Project%20A"}]},{"igdb_id":42187,"name":"Jawbreaker II","summary":"Man!

As with other titles using the Jane's license, the focus of the game is in creating a realistic and believable military aircraft simulation. Hence, the game's controls and mechanics are elaborate, while all controls can be mapped to a voice command. It is also possible to give basic commands to wingmen, if they are present. While waypoints and refueling can be managed by the aircraft's autopilot, all such maneuvers can be done manually. \n \nUSAF is based on 8 different fighters and bombers of the United States Air Force: the F-4E Phantom II, F-105D Thunderchief, A-10A Thunderbolt II, F-15C Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16C Fighting Falcon, F-117A Nighthawk, and the F-22A Raptor. In game modes other than the campaign, the MiG-29 is also available to the player. Each aircraft performs differently and is meant for different tasks, and can be seen from the cockpit (with 2D and 3D views available, and the possibility to look around from the pilot's perspective), from the outside (in a behind view or one of the cinematic views), or with just the HUD visible. \n \nThe game has four campaigns, two of which are historical (Vietnam War and Desert Storm), and the other two (Red Arrow and Sleeping Giant) being fictional and set in a hypothetical future. Tutorials are extensive, while separate tutorials exist under the umbrella term \"Red Flag\", which note more demanding tasks and can not be reached at the lowest rank. The player's progress and rank is recorded in their profile, with each mission's success or failure affecting their score. Scoring itself can be changed by setting various difficulties and \"aids\", with AI help removing score percentages but making the game easier for newcomers. \n \nAside from the campaigns, there are preset single scenarios, as well as a quick mission editor which the player can use to manually set the parameters of a desired air-to-air skirmish (whereas the campaigns have both air-to-ground and air-to-air missions). There is also a Fly Now! button in the main menu, which randomly picks a mission from a small mission pool and puts the player in a random plane. These missions can have the same settings/landscapes as the missions in the campaigns: United States (Nellis Air Force base), Germany, Vietnam, and Iraq. The game comes bundled with a User Mission Editor application as well. USAF has a multiplayer mode available via LAN and JanesCombat.Net (which has since been discontinued). \n \nFinally, the signature feature of Jane's-licensed games is the in-game encyclopaedia, which is present in USAF and lists and describes in detail not only the aircraft the player can pilot or shoot at, but also all other objects that can be encountered in the game, as well as missiles that aircraft can be armed with.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":946598400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yim.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":71486,"name":"Jamdat Word Craft","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wqnmwf1i9wodr8gyulzk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":71629,"name":"Jaws: The Computer Game","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zfbws0ss0nivo6cykmqd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"4183","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Jaws: The Computer Game"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"4575","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-4575/"}]},{"igdb_id":71761,"name":"Jazz Jackrabbit 2: Holiday Hare 98","summary":"Holidays Hare '98 is a standalone release.

It was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 on October 17, 2000, shortly before the release of its PlayStation counterpart. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of MI6 agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games.\n\nThe game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold more than one million copies.","genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"developers":["Eurocom Entertainment Software"],"publishers":["EA","Gradiente"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":971740800,"platforms":["Nintendo 64"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5xsr.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1411254076","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/007:%20The%20World%20is%20Not%20Enough"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"370654151","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/James%20Bond%20007:%20The%20World%20Is%20Not%20Enough"}]},{"igdb_id":144938,"name":"Janitor Bleeds","summary":"Janitor Bleeds is a retro-inspired horror game set in an old arcade, appearing out of nowhere.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Korpus"],"publishers":["Bonus Stage Publishing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1649289600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2vvl.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"894810","url":"https://korpus.itch.io/janitorbleeds"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"9P4R6H39C91J","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/-1-/9P4R6H39C91J"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"65ee1736804a4888b4e1a0961a8d6a37","url":"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/janitor-bleeds-137dee"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"75863708","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/JANITOR%20BLEEDS"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1552310","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1552310"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1509866704","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/janitor_bleeds"}]},{"igdb_id":145340,"name":"Jardinains!","summary":"A breakout clone featuring garden gnomes that fling various objects at you but can be knocked off their bricks, bounced, and destroyed in order to collect powerups.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["Magic Chopstick Games"],"publishers":["Magic Chopstick Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1617148800,"platforms":["Linux","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2wxm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":145638,"name":"Janggun","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xmo.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1971824688","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Janggun"}]},{"igdb_id":146769,"name":"Java-Klingsburg","summary":"This is an independent developers take on the 2007 dice-allocating, worker placement game by Andrea Chiarvesio and Luca Iennaco.\n\nIn Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.\n\nThe game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns.

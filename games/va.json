All the animals were docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas, and other races mingled with one another and worked to make Marvel Land into an increasingly beautiful place to live. A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\n\nThe key of time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the key of time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend. Zouna, the Dark Wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the key of time for himself.\n\nFinally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.\n\nThe desperate call has been answered by the heavens. Valkyrie, a fledgling shield maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven. Her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness that has consumed it. Then her adventure begins.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco","Namco Bandai Games","Bandai Namco Games","Bandai Namco Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":523238400,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS","Wii","Family Computer","Wii U"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4nyc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":348067,"name":"Vampire's Best Friend","summary":"Vampire hunters are after a mischievous vampire girl, and it's up to her pet bat to save the day.

The flyer may give the impression that it uses an isometric perspective but it uses the same overhead view as the first six Pac-Man titles - and, the player must use a 4-directional joystick to take control of a yellow racer car (the eponymous \"Van-Van Car\"), which is on a mission to burst balloons with its front-mounted spike while watching out for the three \"killer\" cars (which are red, green, and blue, so the last one looks somewhat like an evil version of the car from Namco's Rally-X).\n\nEach normal balloon burst will be worth 200 points, regardless of colour; also, if you press that \"Jump Button\", Van-Van Car will jump into the air, and every time it jumps over one of the killer cars, you will receive 100 points. However, if Van-Van Car should land on one of the killer cars, it will (ironically) be killed just as if it had crashed into one - and when there are only eight balloons left, a \"bonus\" balloon will appear in that maze. Once you burst it, you will receive 500 points for every regular balloon left in that maze (so the maximum amount of points you can receive for doing so is 4000); also, if you burst an \"energy\" (yellow) balloon, Van-Van Car will gain a missile. Once you press the Jump Button while in possession of it, Van-Van Car will fire it - and it will destroy any balloons (and killer cars) it ploughs through, for 200 and 1000 points respectively. It is also not advisable to burst another energy balloon until you have fired the missile as Van-Van Car can only hold one at a time, and the killer cars cannot pass over the balloons and will be forced to go around them; the killer cars will also not chase directly after Van-Van Car immediately and will only do so after a preset number of balloons have been burst or a preset amount of time has passed. Finally, Van-Van Car will start spinning around in a clockwise direction at twice its normal speed when it passes over an oil slick - and even though it loses its jump power, it will quickly be able to get away from the killer cars, especially when they are close behind it.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410227200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co80kd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":298116,"name":"Vagrus: The Riven Realms - Old Acquaintances","summary":"Vagrus – The Riven Realms: Old Acquaintances, introduces two new Companions with new abilities, individual and specific loyalty quests that explore their own stories, new enemies and rewards, as well as newfound additions to hirelings that can join owners of the DLC.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["Lost Pilgrims Studio"],"publishers":["Lost Pilgrims Studio"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1718150400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8bkt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":139560,"name":"Valkyria Chronicles 3: Extra Mission - Hard-Ex The Uninvited Crows","summary":"Break through the defense of the Calamity Unit, led by the young, brave commander who was waiting in the mountain fortress and conquer the enemy's main base!","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Tactical"],"developers":["Media.Vision"],"publishers":["Sega"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1300752000,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2x1w.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":212914,"name":"Valete vos viatores","summary":"The ancient Romans erected their tombs and mausoleums along the roads so that travelers could read the inscriptions on their tombstones.

The game takes place two years after the conclusion of the original game and takes you back to the epic adventure set in 1930’s fictitious Europe. In this sequel, you play as a group of young Gallian Military Academy cadets who find themselves plunged into a bitter civil war when the newly formed Gallian Revolutionary Army stages a coup. As the drama and battle unfold, you will experience stories of friendship, love and growing pains during a time of war and revolution.\n\nThe 'CANVAS' engine originally developed by SEGA Game Studios Japan for Valkyria Chronicles has been fully redesigned for the PSP system. This incredibly distinctive engine will power over 20 new distinct and visually stunning environments where you will have over 200 different missions to explore. For the first time ad-hoc Versus and Co-op multiplayer gameplay will now be available. The 'BLiTZ' battle system has also been re-designed to offer players the freedom to strategically move around the environment and attack enemies using real-time controls, something never before seen in the tactical role-playing game genre.\n\nThis game adds some new unit classes and the ability to upgrade or change classes. It also changes the battle system to include multiple map areas that are unlocked as you take over enemy bases revealing more of the battlefield and allowing you to call units into that area.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Tactical"],"developers":["Sega CS3"],"publishers":["Sega"],"aggregated_rating":88.0,"release_date":1264032000,"platforms":["PlayStation Vita","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25zm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":280437,"name":"Valkyrie Saga","summary":"Up high on a floating island, Roll the Valkyrie must ascend and subvert fate.

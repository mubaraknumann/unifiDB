If a single player is selected, the computer operates the second player. In each level, the players must traverse the maze collecting health elixirs and level specific objects while avoiding spooks, bats, spiders and miscellaneous traps. Each player can throw a weapon to dispatch their enemies.\n\nOn each level, the collected objects are either used to activate sites or give them to a white sorcerer for use. When enough have been collected, a key appears somewhere, and once collected this allows the door to the next level to be opened. For the first level, the players collect torches and use them to activate giant skulls. On the second level, gems are collected for the white sorcerer, who appears randomly and infrequently as a ghostly apparition. On the third level, tokens must be deposited into magical wells. On the fourth level, the player must again collect crystals, but they are enchanted, and cannot be picked up unless the player is first given the ability by a white sorcerer. In the final level, the players must find magic eyes for the white sorcerer.\n\nEach player has a health meter, which trickles down with time or drops after contact with a monster. Once the energy reaches zero, the player dies. If this happens to the computer or in two player mode, the first player to die eventually re-animates as an undead creature who pursues the other player. If the living player completes a level, their companion is given extra energy and returned to life with a small amount of energy for the next level.","genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Axis Komputerkunst"],"publishers":["Ariolasoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coabqs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":89987,"name":"Scary Goat 2017","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1504137600,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":58181,"name":"Scramblies","summary":"A puzzle game from Full Fat.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zvnu99dhurpdxnzfxi4g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":91645,"name":"Schwarzschild GX: Sabita Sousei","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":248299,"name":"Scientist Hunt","summary":"Scientist Hunt is a Half-Life modification which makes murdering scientists the objective of the game.

And if being on the same little continent with these creeps isn’t enough, you actually have got to kill them all before you can leave the island… it just isn’t your day! The monsters are hiding in the different buildings on the island and to kill them you’ll have to find an appropriate weapon. For example, to kill Dracula, you’ll need a stake and a hammer and to kill the werewolf a gun with some silver bullets might be useful. All the necessary weapons are too scattered among the different buildings, but not necessarily in the same building as the monster it is suitable for. So you’ll have to roam the island searching through the various buildings, looking for the weapons and the monsters to use them on.

Found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko, the identity of this mysterious Activision prototype has eluded collectors for years. This prototype plays like a cross between a Rubik's Cube and the old sliding tile puzzle game. The goal of the game is to line up all the colors in each row from light to dark. If you've done it correctly the board should look like the start-up screen with the colors descending from red to purple. However lining up all the colors is easier said than done due to the unique way the squares move across the board. When you move your square up or down a row or column, the last square in that row will move behind your square's new position. For instance if your square is the light green one (center of the row), and you move it left it will result in the last square in the row (the light blue one) moving behind it. If you move right instead, the last square on the right (the dark blue one) would move behind your square. Mastering how the squares move is essential to solving the puzzle. If you forget what order the squares should go in, pressing the fire button will cause all the squares in the correct positions to turn black. While this is helpful for positioning the shades of color in each row, it won't help you remember what color is supposed to go in each row.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mqb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":267609,"name":"Scorpius","summary":"Very difficult horizontally-scrolling shooting game.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":670377600,"platforms":["Sharp X68000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7j95.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":21152,"name":"Scribble Shooter","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":153554,"name":"Screaming Loaf","summary":"Screaming Loaf is a wacky puzzle-platform game.\n\nThe fridge contents have one goal; to become a sandwich.

The game is played using 5 buttons; move left, move right, scream, jump, and drop a slice. Different enemies have different strengths, so some may require multiple screams to eliminate. Screaming is not only good for damaging enemies, Loaf's scream can also push levers and propel himself across water. Loaf is made up of 5 slices, Loaf has the ability to leave slices behind and re-join with them later, any dropped slices will scream at the same time as the control slice. More points are scored for completing levels quickly, so dropping slices in next to where enemies are about to spawn is useful to defeat them more efficiently. Dropping slices plays a big part in puzzle solving too. Slices also act as health, a slice is lost from Loaf upon enemy collision.

In Gosling it seemed the sun always shined, your neighbors smiled, and the harvests were bountiful. Yes, life in the valley was good. Factor in the mushrooms, and well, life wasn't just good, it was great! \n \nAh yes, the mushrooms. The valley was full of them, and each one was special. There were enormous mushrooms that were used as homes, and small ones that could be brewed into liquor (including everyone's tavern favorite, ShroOOom! ale). Some mushrooms were best buttered and fried, while other mushrooms were typically dried and smoked. There were mushrooms that healed the sick, and even some that could make magic! \n \nThen the troubles began. Bizarre creatures prowled the valley, the wildlife fled, and once full larders laid bare. The citizens of Gosling smiled at each other no more, instead spending their days hiding in terror. Worse, with the blight upon the land the mushrooms that once provided so much now provided so little. Even the casks of ShroOOom! ale were almost dry! \n \nBig Will, an old farmer, sought out the source of the evil. Nestled high in the hills, he found the source: a dank and dark cave that oozed evil, a terrible open sore in the land that spewed forth nightmares. Big Will did not go in, though. He'd let someone else have all the glory. Someone, such as YOU! \n \nYou are Rapius, mighty farm laborer. The blood of the Gods do not flow in your veins. You were not prophesized about a thousand years prior by three blind crones. Yet it is you, Rapius, that will seek out and destroy the source of evil. \n \nRapius, grab your lantern and make haste! For the good of the people, the lands, and the mushrooms - especially the mushrooms! Have you seen what they're charging for a pint of ShroOOm! ale lately? Go forth, descend into the earth! Leave a tramp and come back a scallywag! All of Gosling awaits your triumph - your triumph in the lair of the Medusa! \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa is a single-player, action orientated dungeonbash of unlimited potential. Taking the role of Rapius players fight their way through eighty levels of randomly generated dungeon exploration, braving dozens of unique subterranean dangers in a quest to cleanse the ultimate evil within the catacombs. \n \nDown in the dark players will gain gear, craft items, learn magic, eat 'shrooms, turn to stone, become invisible, get drunk, be hungover, learn to fly, speed up, muscle up, regenerate, smoke fungus, get diseased, get lost, get found, and more! Careful use of Rapius' lantern will allow players to strike from afar, or for tough encounters, sneak by silently in the dark. \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa also comes complete with RAGe, the Random Adventure Game engine. Craft whole new adventures for Rapius, or even make entirely new games! Everything (and we mean everything) can be modded with RAGe, no programming experience necessary! \n \nDo you have what it takes to survive eighty levels of terrible beasts, cruel hazards, and some mind blowing mushrooms?

Scratches is the first commercial adventure game ever to be made in Argentina.\n\nThe game tells the story of the Blackwood estate on the outskirts of Rothbury, a small rural town in Northumberland, England in 1976.\n\nOriginally owned by James T. Blackwood in 1963, the house is passed to Christopher Milton after Mr. Blackwood is accused of murdering his wife. A couple of days later, Mr. Blackwood dies of a sudden heart attack though some in the town start rumors that he might have committed suicide. The police decide to close the case seeing there is no further evidence left. Shortly after acquiring the house, Milton inexplicably disappears in 1970 leaving no visible trace.\n\nThe player assumes the role of the house's next inhabitant, Michael Arthate, an author seeking seclusion to work on his next book. He moves in only to find that the house still echoes its horrible past quite literally as scratches are heard all around, particularly in the basement and fireplaces, and soon becomes more interested in researching the house's history than his writing.\n\nScratches uses a first person perspective to navigate around the house. Using only a mouse, the player can access various rooms and other places in order to solve the mystery of both Blackwood and Milton's disappearances. It features music and special sound effects by the now defunct Cellar of Rats, which contribute to the fearsome ambience experienced at the mansion, crypt, greenhouse and church.\n\nThe game is heavily influenced by the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and several direct references to Lovecraft works make their appearances in Scratches. There are in-game references to the Necronomicon, De Vermis Mysteriis, Lovecraft's story \"The Mountains of Madness,\" as well as one critics of Michael's book being called R'yleh. Michael states in the game he had just moved to Rothbury from Providence, Rhode Island-the hometown of Lovecraft.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":["Nucleosys"],"publishers":["Got Game Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":1141776000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4o8x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":67683,"name":"School Rumble: Nee-san Jiken Desu!","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":238389,"name":"Scooter Boy","summary":"Classic endless runner gameplay with an innovative swiping twist.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":178896,"name":"Scrambled: Syd City","summary":"The choice between good and evil, with a human life in the balance... is only a bang away.","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Team Rumblebee"],"publishers":["Team Rumblebee"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1541376000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ubt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":319148,"name":"Scramble Heart City","summary":"From the team behind Tough Love Arena comes Scramble Heart City, an exciting, 3v3 tag team fighting game that's playable in browser — no installation required!","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["M.

Night of 100 Frights is a third person platform game with action elements that was developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox consoles. The game was first released on May 20, 2002 in North America and was released later that year in PAL regions. It is the first Scooby-Doo! video game title to come to sixth generation consoles. The game became a Greatest Hits title in 2003.[1] The game had a follow up titled Scooby Doo: Mystery Mayhem.\n\nThe game puts players in the control of Scooby-Doo in a story that revolves around him searching for the rest of the gang around a haunted mansion after they're kidnapped by an eccentric villain. The game has twelve areas, ranging from graveyards and secret labs to fishing villages and haunted mazes.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, mainly criticizing the game's simplicity, although its massive environments staying true to the Scooby-Doo! universe was praised by critics and fans alike. Fans of the original show loved the game, feeling it was compensation for the N64 game released in 2000. The game also marks the first and only time Don Knotts did voice work for a video game, though he did do previous voice work in the Scooby-Doo universe.[2]","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Heavy Iron Studios"],"publishers":["THQ"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1021852800,"platforms":["Xbox","Nintendo GameCube","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ozq.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"15114","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15114/"}]},{"igdb_id":120649,"name":"Scribble It!","summary":"Scribble it! brings classic party drawing games back to life.

The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States.\n\nThe game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["Harmonix Music Systems"],"publishers":["RedOctane"],"aggregated_rating":89.0,"release_date":1131408000,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wa0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":1288,"name":"Gun.Smoke","summary":"Gun.Smoke is very similar to Commando, another Capcom game, but with several differences.

However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n\nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["Neversoft Entertainment"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":81.4,"release_date":1251763200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","Xbox 360","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co53lb.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"24711","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-24711/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"22371","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Guitar Hero 5"}]},{"igdb_id":2673,"name":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith","summary":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith puts the player in the shoes of \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\" as they evolve from unknowns to rock superstars.

Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.\n\nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc.\n\nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["Neversoft Entertainment"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":1238284800,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","Xbox 360","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wni.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"20469","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Guitar Hero: Metallica"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"UC3K3q3a2edIfCtVhZHFId1A","url":"https://gaming.youtube.com/game/UC3K3q3a2edIfCtVhZHFId1A"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"22562","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-22562/"}]},{"igdb_id":2675,"name":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen","summary":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen lets you stand in the shoes of this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band as you perform 25 epic Van Halen tracks, three signature Eddie Van Halen solos and 19 guest act tracks.

While the console versions of Guitar Hero use a separate guitar-shaped peripheral, Vicarious Visions developed a \"Guitar Grip\" unit that slips into the Game Boy Advance port on the DS or the DS Lite to be used with the games; the Grip is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS. The Guitar Grip provides a strap to hold the game unit while providing the player with four fret buttons; the player uses the fret buttons in combination with using the stylus to simulate strumming on the touch-sensitive screen of the DS. Each game features more than 25 songs, with some variation in track lists depending on the region of release, and multiple single-player modes. The local wi-fi capabilities of the DS are used for multiplayer mode, and allow a player to use songs from one installment of the series in competitive modes with a player with a different installment.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["Vicarious Visions"],"publishers":["Activision Publishing Minneapolis Inc.","RedOctane"],"aggregated_rating":65.0,"release_date":1214092800,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w9z.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":7089,"name":"Guitar Hero: On Tour - Decades","summary":"\"Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades expands the experience of Guitar Hero: On Tour by letting you rock out to some of the biggest hits from the 70s, 80s, 90s and today.

The Dreamcast version's distinguishing feature was that during the game's development, GunValkyrie utilized a unique control scheme using both a light gun and a controller. This control scheme was dropped when development shifted to the Xbox version.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from most third-person shooters, due to a unique dual analog control scheme, which is the main contributor to the steep learning curve of the game. Players travel to various worlds investigating the disappearance of several colonies, with only giant mutated insect creatures left behind. These insects comprise the bulk of the enemies you face along the way.\n\nPlayers control Kelly or Saburouta with both analog sticks, the left controlling forward/backward movement and turning, while the right aims their weapons, and when clicked, allows quick-turns. Clicking in the left stick while pointing in a direction causes the character to boost. The left trigger is a boost/jump, and when combined with the left analog boost, can be strung together into combos to keep the player off the ground entirely, which is a necessity for some levels. Face buttons are used to select weapons, and the right trigger fires the selected weapon.\n\nThe game comprises ten levels, the story unfolding via text between levels, or the occasional in-game cutscene. At the beginning of most levels, excluding boss battles, you have the choice of picking either Kelly or Saburouta. Kelly's primary weapon is fast but weaker, and she's overall faster and more maneuverable. Saburouta is slower, has more limited maneuverability in the air, and carries a stronger primary weapon, the Matchlock Cannon. Basically the two characters make up the two difficulty settings, with Kelly being the \"Normal\", and Saburouta being the \"Advanced\" setting. The real difference being that Kelly's style allowed several lock-on targets, while Saburouta's weapon splashed and was aimed at specific targets. Because of this, Kelly's gameplay is more frantic and requires less direct focus, while Saburota required specific aiming and direct attacks to be effective. Kelly is also the only character to upgrade her gearskin.\n\nThe artistic style of the game is similar to the steampunk subgenre of fiction, but the game's designers prefer to call it \"elec-punk,\" described as a step even further, with the harnessing of electricity for imaginative new uses. The game's stages are divided into indoor mechanical looking levels, with lots of gears and ornate metalwork, and outdoor stages, set in very organic looking valley's, craters, and other fantastic otherworldly locations.","genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"developers":["Smilebit"],"publishers":["Sega"],"aggregated_rating":51.0,"release_date":1016409600,"platforms":["Xbox","Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7jvd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":10382,"name":"Guncraft","summary":"Block and Load!!

Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own!

The seeds were flung outward, toward the edge of the galaxy, beyond where Atlas’s power had ever reached. The seeds drifted for endless centuries. One by one, they were lost in the vast darkness between the stars. Only a single seed survived. Weakened and dying, Atlas’s instincts drove it toward the nearest suitable planet.

Vast swathes of its surface had been sheared of all organic material, all an effort by a powerful artificial intelligence known as the Librarian to convert the planet into a single computer.

With so little organic matter to work with, the power used what it had. Millions of new life forms, some organic, some cybernetic — but most of them a combination of both — were born instantly. Four essences, or Guardians, greater than the others, emerged from the seed.

Heroes, each sworn to one of the four guardians, flocked to the continent. There were no rules, no boundaries, no laws. The new land was full of dangers and demanded alliances - but alliances on Arctora are ephemeral things. Each Guardian was determined to be the one to find the energy source and regrow Atlas… and to take its power for itself.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1474848000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2q9z.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"55137","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-55137/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"493039","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Guardians of Atlas"}]},{"igdb_id":46781,"name":"Guardians: Denjin Makai II","summary":"Guardians (ガーディアンズ?), also known as Denjinmakai II (電神魔傀II?), is a side-scrolling beat 'em up developed by Winkysoft and published by Banpresto that was exclusively released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1995 as the successor of the 1994 arcade game Denjinmakai.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Winkysoft"],"publishers":["Banpresto"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":788918400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gue.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":46801,"name":"Guitar Freaks","summary":"GuitarFreaks is a music video game series produced by Konami.

The War for Earth was developed by the 1990s game developer Presto Studios, a company whose most famous work was the Journeyman Project series of adventure games as well as co-developing Myst III: Exile.\n\nDuring the period in which this game was released, the interactive movie genre which had begun in 1982 was beginning to subside as PC and console games with realtime rendered 3D were overtaking the genre. While it was the only game produced by Presto Studios in this format, the use of live-action footage featuring real actors combined with computer generated backgrounds and effects, as well as the use of entirely pre-rendered computer graphics was common among the majority of the studio's games.

Be sure to read the fine print.\n\nThis is Guildlings, a new story-driven episodic adventure brought to you by Asher Vollmer (maker of Threes), IGF award-winner Jamie Antonisse, and the team of dedicated indies at Sirvo Studios. Drawing inspiration from classic RPGs, point and click puzzlers and visual novel games, it tells a lighthearted coming-of-age fantasy tale within a modern mobile frame.\n\nFeatures:\n- Traverse hand-crafted low-poly environments, including floating ruins, a tavern built from a shipwrecked boat, and the mountaintop teen hangout known as “Makeout Temple”.\n- Use a text-message inspired chat system to make conversations and choices. Characters will react to your decisions in satisfying (and sometimes hilarious) ways.\n- Leverage your Guild members’ abilities in playful turn-based combat. Each Guildling has a unique set of powers tied to their personality.\n- Affect the world around you through your Guildmaster magic. A single touch can unlock doors, open treasure chests, or even blow up your dad’s favorite lamp.\n- Guildlings’ magic powers are tied to their moods. This system ties conversation, exploration and combat together.

Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing action-packed mecha-on-mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: the building of Gunpla model kits! The management mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own model kit based on their real-life counterparts.\n\nThere are over 100 Gunpla kits to choose from, which gives you endless building opportunities! You can colorize parts, define material types such as plastic or chrome, add decals, scale optional loadouts, and save your kits into a list to restore whenever you want to fight with that model.\n\nAside from customizing the entire body, you get a shield, melee weapon, and ranged weapon slot for your primary arsenal, 4 Ex-Actions for explosive attacks, and 8 slots for your optional loadouts which can include missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, beam sabers, axes, and all sorts of other offensive and defensive mechanisms. This is one of the most freeform combat experiences ever made in 3rd person arena combat.\n\nTwo escorts join you in most of the battles, performing healing and attack actions while also rescuing you from being knocked out. You can also instruct them to do certain actions.\n\nA new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode, players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency and all parts that have been broken off of enemy kits.\n\nThe Break Edition includes all the DLC of the normal edition.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1483228800,"platforms":["PlayStation 4"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4kys.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":136352,"name":"Guitar Hero Live: Supreme Party Edition","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5ez2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":136696,"name":"Gundam Versus: Premium G Sound Edition","summary":"Bring the fight home!","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9de7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":137024,"name":"Guild of Greats","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"500214","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Guild of Greats"}]},{"igdb_id":137411,"name":"Guntica","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2qaa.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":137461,"name":"Guild of Darksteel","summary":"Guild of Darksteel is a story-driven adventure game set in a rich, dark fantasy world.

The risks involved prevent all but the most tenacious (and perhaps foolhardy) of pursuers from investigating the Inquest’s plan. Your race to discover the Inquest’s plot will lead you across two new open world regions at launch, each filled with magical energies and strange creatures. Two additional maps will open as the story continues over the course of a year.\n\nDuring your travels, you’ll unlock three new Mastery tracks, including one for your Skimmer mount that will unlock new and updated abilities. The new region also brings new adventures, collections, and thematic rewards. Players who own both Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity and Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will be able to unlock a new Castoran Homestead map.\n\nA new elite specialization for each profession will unlock new traits, profession mechanics, and healing, utility, and elite skills. Further augment your build by acquiring new relics themed to your adventures in Castora. And work towards six legendary rewards: three new legendary weapons, plus a ring, accessory, and aquabreather.\n\nThe magically infused landscape of Castora is home to all manner of strange, warped wildlife. Two of the three major updates coming in 2026 will pit players against the most powerful of the island’s denizens in Raid Encounters (including Challenge Modes and a Legendary Mode) and a new Convergence. Along with the first of the new Raid Encounters, new system updates will make raids easier to access. A Fractal with an accompanying Challenge Mode will also release with the last of the major expansion updates.\n\nNew emotes, armors, weapons, recipes, and other unique rewards await those who brave the dangers of Castora, and seasonal Wizard’s Vault refreshes throughout the expansion will bring additional options for unique aesthetic rewards.\n\nTo support the addition of a new Homestead map, we’re introducing two additional features. The first, the ability to freely swap between the Janthiri and Castoran maps, is helped by the second feature, Layouts. Layouts create a file you can use to save, load, share, and edit arrangements of decorations. We’ll share more about these and other features as we get nearer to the launch of Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["ArenaNet®"],"publishers":["ArenaNet®"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1761609600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa54y.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3845870","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3845870"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"bfbeea4bd2b5434dbc085484fc34569b","url":"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/guild-wars-2-guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-c70911"}]},{"igdb_id":356397,"name":"Gumbo* and the Machine","summary":"A 2D Tower Defense Shooter Platformer!\nYou play as Gumbo as you emerge from your MACHINE!\n\nBuy Upgrades from chef peppino he isn't too happy about his demotion from main character to shop keeper but he may know secrets...\n\nGo through 7 waves with a final boss or tough it out through the infinite gauntlet!\n\nand you must.

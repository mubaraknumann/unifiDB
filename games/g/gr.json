well as exploration sections that will submerge us in possible secondary contents that are developed aside from the main story, complementing it.\n\nFollowing the disappearance of a family while hiking in the forests of Steelrock Canyon National Park, Dylan Riley, a veteran member of the search and rescue unit, suffers an accident that leaves him alone in the middle of the night and lost in an unexplored zone of the woods that has been closed to the public because of the dangers it may harbor. But... Is he really alone? Shadows glide through the trees, watching him, strange whispers accompany his steps like a creepy leitmotiv, and something that has inhabited those woods for eons wants to make it clear that he is not welcomed there.\n\nMain Features:\n\nAtmospheric exploration - The forest that covers the natural reserve like a green mantle hides many secrets and dangers buried by the time, that's the reason why many of its zones have been declared closed to the public. It's been a long time since the forgotten paths that wind through the undergrowth have been walked ... until now.\n\nPuzzle Solving - There are many hidden mysteries in the dark corners of Steelrock Canyon's forest waiting to be unveiled, old knowledge yearning to be pronounced again, and more complex motivations than it may seem at first.\n\nSurvive! - Take care of your wounds, seek help and escape the threats that wait for you in every corner. It seems as if the forest around you is alive ... and you can not trust it.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Bad2theBone Studio"],"publishers":["Bad2theBone Studio"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1517443200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mrhrzqp60ggzvx8vwphp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":361702,"name":"Groove Coaster: Touhou DLC Pack 02","summary":null,"genres":["Music"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":361700,"name":"Groove Coaster: Game Music Pack 01","summary":null,"genres":["Music"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":33346,"name":"Grand Pigeon's Duty","summary":"Pigeons organized resistance, which aims to attract people's attention to the problem of hunger and restore bakery companies for their bait.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Strategy","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["WolfgangIs"],"publishers":["WolfgangIs"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1470355200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co41fe.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":363039,"name":"Grimm: Quest for the Gatherer's Key","summary":"Grimm Quest for the Gatherer's Key is a Hack and Slash Fantasy game with some platforming elements that leans heavily on extremely bloody and satisfying gameplay.

Carom your shots against the moving wall to fill in the pattern on the back grid. \n \nThis original game by Andy Sells looked great; it had a strong 3-D effect as the moving wall swept back and forth across the screen. But while Andy wanted to continue developing the game, management wanted to take advantage of his musical talents. (Shortly before coming to Mattel, his award-winning song \"You Love Love [More Than You Love Me]\" was recorded by the English group Buck's Fizz. Ask for it by name.) \n \nAndy was continually assigned to work on music and sound effects for other games, including Shark! Shark! and TRON Solar Sailer. He also co-developed the Intellivision sound development tool, Mr. Sound. Whenever he had a chance he returned to Grid Shock, but the game was never elevated to official status. \n \nWhile the game never made it onto the Intellivision release schedule, it was demonstrated as part of the Intellivision III product line. This was bogus; when the Intellivision III wasn't ready to be shown at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, regular Intellivision screens with particularly nice graphics were passed off as examples of the forthcoming system. Grid Shock was one of these; color packaging was even printed up for it. \n \nAfter C.E.S., Andy never had a chance to return to the game. His boss, Manager Russ Haft, left Mattel for Atari; Andy was tapped to take his place. A short time later, Andy, too, left for Atari and Grid Shock was abandoned.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":886291200,"platforms":["Intellivision"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pfa.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":175333,"name":"Gravity Range","summary":"It is a simple interesting game.

This game takes place during that time. In 1942, special German forces have invaded Tibet and are searching for more to add to their Führer's arsenal - the 12 \"miracle\" weapons of King Arunja in an undiscovered \"Lost City\". One of these weapons, according to legend, could obliterate major cities, wiping them off the face of the earth. The player takes the part of Colonel Grom, a member of the Polish army fighting the Nazis during World War II. Grom is a seasoned and shrewd commander who has his own personal score to settle with the Germans.\n\nGROM: Terror in Tibet is a predominantly role-playing game with elements of stealth and emphasis on tactical combat. The player controls a party of characters, navigating them through towns and other locations in a fairly linear fashion, often engaging in conversations with multiple dialogue choices. Travelling between the various locations is handled by way of a country map. Combat system has similarities to that of Baldur's Gate, with real-time management and the ability to pause in order to issue commands. Unlike in most RPGs, the characters themselves do not level up in this game; their only growing attribute is weapon proficiency, which plays an important role in combat.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["Rebelmind"],"publishers":["cdv Software Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1038182400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ov3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":337249,"name":"Greek Kitchen Frenzy: Dionysus - Collector's Edition","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":115381,"name":"Grove flowers","summary":"This game is similar in style to the Arcanoid.

The player can perform a variety of different attacks (punches, kicks, and finishing blows) depending on the position of an enemy. By pressing both buttons while surrounded by enemies, the player can perform a special attack that strikes every enemy around him. By pressing both buttons while holding the joystick upwards, the player will perform a longer jump.\n\nThe player can procure weapons by destroying barrels and wooden crates or disarming certain enemies. There are a total of eight weapons which can be obtained: three melee weapons (a pipe, a sword and a whip), two throwing weapons (knives and hand grenades), and three firearms (a pistol, a machine gun, and a rocket launcher). The barrels and crates can also be picked up and thrown at enemies as well. When the machine gun or rocket launcher runs out of ammunition, these are still wielded by the player as melee weapons. The pistol, on the other hand, is thrown by the player after all of its bullets are used. The player can drop his current weapon by pressing down and attack while wielding it. If a weapon lies on the ground after a certain period, it will vanish completely.\n\nThere are seven regular stages (called rounds) and a bonus game, for a total of eight stages. The locations include a city, a moving train, a boat, a jungle, a cavern, and the hideout of the poachers. There are six types of enemy characters throughout the game, excluding the final boss (who has two forms).

In Grim Legions, you control units that move around the map trying to capture towns. Each turn, the towns recruit more units. The aim of the game is simply to wipe out your enemy (destroy all their troops and capture all their towns). There can be up to 4 players, and you can make alliances with other players.\n\nThere are three different types of troop: infantry, archers and cavalry. There's not much difference between these types, archers are just better than infantry, and cavalry better than archers. Unlike a lot of other games, you can combine multiple troop types in one unit (or \"legion\"), and you can split and merge them as much as you like.\n\nMap generation is randomized, but you have a lot of control over it. E.g. if you get sick of your units taking ages to move through the mountains, you can just generate a map without mountains. You can also decide how much of the map you want to be water (which no troops can move through), from 0% to 60%. There are also 3 map sizes to choose from. This means - despite the relatively simple gameplay - there are quite a few different scenarios. You can end up spending a lot more time playing this game than you think!\n\nGrim Legions is currently in open beta.

The game incorporates existing Green Day songs already released for the Rock Band series as downloadable content, and allows players to export its full tracklist to the other Rock Band game titles except The Beatles: Rock Band.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["Demiurge Studios","Harmonix Music Systems"],"publishers":["MTV Games"],"aggregated_rating":71.71428571428571,"release_date":1275955200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lqosuxce4clnfiwr6lot.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"26546","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Green%20Day%3A%20Rock%20Band"},{"category":11,"store":null,"uid":"xbox36066acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108e7","url":"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Green-Day-Rock-Band/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108e7"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"29439","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-29439/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108e7","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/Green-Day-Rock-Band/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108e7"}]},{"igdb_id":379691,"name":"Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising - Weapon Skin Set: Battle Pass Pack 4","summary":"Contents: Unlocks weapon skin no. 10 for Gran (Prototype), Metera (Eon), Lowain (Wales' Finest), Ferry (Flame Lit Curl), and Beatrix (Embrasque Demiclone).","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1754265600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":147067,"name":"Great Battles of Carolus XII","summary":"Great Battles of Carolus XII is a very simple hexagon-based strategy game developed by a new Swedish indie game studio.

The game was produced by much of the same staff who worked on the company's previous role-playing endeavor, the Lunar series, including producer Yoichi Miyagi and music composer Noriyuki Iwadare.\n\nSince its release, Grandia has become notable for its combat mechanics, which have been carried over to future games within the franchise, and has spawned two spin-off titles – Grandia: Digital Museum and Grandia: Parallel Trippers – both released exclusively in Japan. In celebration of the announcement of renewing development on Grandia Online, which acts as a prequel to Grandia, the game was re-released on Sony's PlayStation Network platform in Japan as a downloadable title in April 2009 and in North America on February 25, 2010.

Players had to skim surfaces of the planets and destroy all the bunkers therein, as well as beam up fuel cells to maintain their fuel level(s) and avoiding or destroying saucers that would also appear. The game did not do very well commercially and would only be ported to the Atari 2600 a few years later (although it has reappeared on some modern day compilations since). \n \nGravitrex is a clone of Gravitar, although with many differences, such as the addition of humans dotting the planetary landscapes that have to be rescued, and the Gravitrex Plus cart also includes two bonus games and other features as well. All games are for one player only. \n \nGameplay: \n \nThe player controls a fighter ship that begins each game in a solar system. There is a sun in the middle and several planets to choose from to enter so the player can start their mission. If the player takes too long with choosing a planet, a pair of space saucers will emerge from the reactor planet and will engage the player in a dogfight if they get close enough (although the player can just elude them by entering a planet). If the player’s ship gets destroyed or the player shoots both saucers then the player will return to the main solar system screen. \nOnce the player enters a planet by thrusting into it, they must destroy every enemy bunker on the surface and dispose of every fuel tank and human. Humans and fuel tanks can be shot (although the player will not receive any points for doing so), but a bonus is given if all humans are rescued on a level (see Scoring and Extras sections), plus fuel tanks are needed to keep up the player’s fuel level (which is indicated by a line right next to the score at the top left of the screen). Humans and fuel tanks can be teleported into the player’s ship by maneuvering their ship close and activating the teleporter/shields function. Once all bunkers have been destroyed and all humans and fuel tanks have been disposed of, a sound effect will signal that the mission is complete, and upon leaving the planet, it will self-destruct and the player will be given a bonus for that planet. \n \nThe exception to this rule is the lone reactor planet on each level, which has only one target – a reactor – deep inside it. This planet is different than all the others, as the player is given 99 time units to make their way through a brief maze, shoot the reactor, and get out before time runs out or else the player’s ship will be destroyed and the reactor will remain intact. If the player does not destroy this planet last in a level then it clears out the space saucers for the remainder of the level, since this is the planet that they emerge from. \n \nDangers include the player’s ship crashing if it runs out of fuel, plus the ship will be destroyed if shot by a bunker, space saucer or alien air interceptor (which are similar to space saucers but they appear inside a planet), if they crash into a wall, the sun, space saucer or alien air interceptor, or do not leave the reactor planet before their time runs out. If the player runs out of reserve ships then the game will end. The player’s fuel, however, is replenished mostly from a fuel tank and is fully replaced upon destroying a planet, finishing a level, or with each new ship. The player’s teleporter function also doubles as a shield to protect them from enemy fire. Also, if the player defeats all planets in a level, then that level’s sun will go nova, various bonuses are then awarded (see Extras section), and if the player defeats the third level the game will end, giving a congratulations message as well as sharing some trivia about Gravitrex from the game’s programmer John Dondzila on the screen.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1012521600,"platforms":["Vectrex"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":84255,"name":"Ground Attack","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Silversoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["ZX Spectrum"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co87qp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":109177,"name":"Grimms Nightmare","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":191486,"name":"Grand Theft Auto: Montevideo City","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4hhm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":73476,"name":"Gravity Fight","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":94220,"name":"Grid Iron 2","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":93106,"name":"Grand Ouvert","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":189295,"name":"Grow Flow","summary":"A first person parkour game with art inspired by european avant-gardes.

To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given a new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm. No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun?\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 02\nA VIP arriving from abroad mysteriously disappears in transit. The SORD team at Mihama Academy is presented with a new mission: finding and recovering him. Whenever they appear to be closing in on this missing \"package\", though, it somehow slips through their fingers. Accompanying them on their mission are two fellow SORD from the Kyousen Sakuragaoka campus - twin sisters, who both help and hinder the crew. There have also been rumors floating around of a daredevil biker named \"Soul Speed\", who tears up the streets at night. Before long, the team's thrilling chase descends into a deathmatch, pushing the combatants to their limits and beyond. Rena and Haruto, meanwhile, are taken on a journey deep into the past, to their first-ever encounter.\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 03\nWhile Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip. Within moments of their arrival, though, the Mihama gang are pulled into a manhunt for a SORD deserter, assisted by students Sylvia and Velvet of St. Aile's International School. Tohka's the star of the show this time round, but she's wrestling with her own issues - old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep...\n“You're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.”\n“Let's meet up again someday... if we're still alive.”\nAnd introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's:\n“If taking her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I simply want to see this mess cleaned up.”\nWhat answers will Tohka find?\nShe has the truth in her sights...\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 04\nKumashiro Megumi (Gumi), recently transferred from St. Aile's International School, has been training hard together with Rena and Maki – now fully recovered from their injuries. With the help of her mentor, Tohka, she's shaping up to be a fine sniper.\nJust as one new student settles in, another has her sights set on joining the girls in Class A, Mihama's elite combat unit. Her name? Sengoku Taiga. Haruto, the team's handler, has one condition for Taiga's transfer: that Chris serves as her supervising officer.\nThe two seem an unlikely pair at first, but after spending some time with little Taiga, Chris soon finds a way to see things from her perspective.\nIt's at that moment that the nation is suddenly rocked by a terror attack on an unprecedented scale. Chris rushes to the scene, aware of what's at stake, but paying no heed to the dangers ahead.\nJust as she did, once before.\n\"This is even worse than we could've imagined...\"\nThe death toll keeps on rising, but SORD are stuck watching helplessly from the sidelines. What destiny awaits Chris, Taiga... and Mihama Academy?\n\"Oh, right... I must have died...\"\nClutching to memories of her long-dead mother, she too prepares for an eternity of slumber...\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 05\nA few weeks have passed since SORD successfully resolved the Kitaoka University terrorist incident - albeit with some sacrifices - when Murasaki's older sister Yuuki returns to Japan and returns to Mihama Academy.\nBeing more sociable and capable than her sister, Yuuki immediately befriends the other students and builds a trusting relationship with them.\n\"There's no reason for me to be at Mihama anymore...\"\nAs Murasaki starts questioning her raison d'etre, she reminisces about the time when she first met Haruto.\nA few years earlier...\nLamenting his lack of experience, he had come to her village hidden deep in the mountains in search of new skills.\nHe got to know the Ikoma sisters better and kept up with his training. As he seeks out the village's \"secret art\", a sudden tragedy befalls them.\n\"I'll never forgive you...!!\"\n\"It's okay... Don't worry... I'm not... going anywhere...

Borrowing its name and looks from the original Gravity Force by Kingsoft, which was an advanced Thrust clone, it diverts from its namesake by being a two-player-only game. \n \nGF2 stands out not only because of its clean graphics and sense of humour, but also because of its enormous range of preferences in order to customise the physics variables and capabilities of the players ship so as to make the game perfectly suited to each player. Furthermore, it has a stunning amount of levels on varying themes, more of which could be created with the level editor (available to registered users). \n \nThe different levels of GF2 are split up into themes such as Grass Worlds, Lego Worlds, Slime Worlds and Boring Worlds. Each player starts out on his home base with a fully loaded ship. The objective is simply to destroy the player by any means possible, be they to simply shoot him down, bomb him or to ram him into a wall, thereby depleting his shields. If your shields, fuel or ammunition is running low, you must return to your (or even you opponent's) base to refuel. However, landing makes you vulnerable to enemy bombardments. \n \nApart from the plain dogfighting levels, GF2 also offers a large amount of race levels, where the players race around a maze-like level where they must pass check points. Flying your ship around these levels is not as easy as it may seem, since you must fight gravity, just as in Thrust, but unlike Asteroids. \n \nGF2 was part, if not the progenitor, of the cave-flying trend that hit the Amiga in the mid-nineties, alongside games such as Bratwurst or Turboraketti.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Bits Productions"],"publishers":["Bits Productions"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":773020800,"platforms":["Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ocso3mobuj3tkyswva9v.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":143374,"name":"Grand Champion","summary":"Grand champion is a cancelled racing game for the Epoch Cassette Vision.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Epoch"],"publishers":["Epoch"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Epoch Cassette Vision"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2sq7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":169109,"name":"Great Marble Adventure","summary":"Guide the marble in the journey through more than 40 thematic levels across three difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with various challenges in Great Marble Adventure, an unforgettable 3D ball-rolling game!

The link to the download was pulled from the site on August 8, 2006. The game was subsequently released on a German website dedicated to Flash and freeware games and is available for Windows, OS X and Linux.\n\nUnlike Geometry Wars which eventually plateaus in difficulty facilitating high scores in the range of hundreds of millions of points, GridWars 2 has an exponentially increasing difficulty curve. Eventually, the enemy spawn sites become so large that they nearly envelop the entire grid.\n\nAnother important difference from Geometry Wars is the ability to \"farm\" black holes.

Four incarnations of the game were produced during its one-year development; the first featured more common first-person shooter elements than the released version. Subsequent versions shifted in a new direction, with the inclusion of more spy-oriented gameplay.\n\nGravity Bone received critical acclaim from video game journalists. It was called \"a pleasure to experience\" by Charles Onyett from IGN, and received comparisons to games such as Team Fortress 2 and Portal. The game was praised for its cohesive story, atmosphere and its ability to catch the player's interest over a very short time span without feeling rushed or incomplete. It received the \"Best Arthouse Game\" award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008.

The Gauge has a display like a clock, with the numbers 1 to 12, and at the start of a battle one of the numbers will glow. The glowing number will move clockwise each time an ally or enemy performs an action. At this time, if you use a skill corresponding to the glowing number, a Just Time Bonus will be triggered, and the level of the Gauge will recover by a large amount. Also, the level of the Gauge increases, although only by a little, when enemies are defeated.\n\nThe Gauge is shared across all party members, so it's a good idea to pay attention to the level as you use Particular Skills and launch Interrupt Actions!","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Magitec"],"publishers":["Kemco"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1398902400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7hc9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":32180,"name":"GravPool","summary":"A simulation of the version of billiards that space pilgrims played during the starship migrations of the 2300s.

Difficulty is gauged by the length of the course, the number of cars and oil slicks on the track, and the number of bridges to cross. The player views the race from a top-down perspective, and the screen scrolls from right to left. The player's car maneuvers only on a vertical axis, and loses a little speed when it does so. The joystick's button is the throttle: Depressing it accelerates, and releasing it decelerates. Pressing the joystick leftward applies the brake. The transmission audibly shifts as the player's car accelerates and decelerates. Grand Prix is a time trial, and the competing cars are obstacles rather than competition for the finish line. The player's car can easily outpace the other cars, but if it collides with one, its speed drops lower than that of the impacted car. Driving over an oil slick causes the player's car to skid slightly sideways, but does not slow it down. Once every scale mile, the player crosses a narrow bridge over blue water. Colliding with any wall of the bridge stops the car, and the player must slowly gain speed to continue.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Activision"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":64.0,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6i2b.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":51830,"name":"Great Battles Collector's Edition","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":915062400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dvv54wvg18rqxe545n01.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12528,"name":"Gravity Rush 2","summary":"Another mind-bending adventure awaits gravity queen Kat as a new danger emerges to threaten the fabric of the universe itself.

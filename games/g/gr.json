The gameplay goes way beyond mere shooting and leads players to score highly by engaging with the game's mechanic to produce aesthetically pleasing abstract graphics “performances” as they play.\n\nSeveral game modes are included, along with simulations of the original Vic and C64 games so that players can see for themselves the game's history and how it has evolved in the 21st century.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["Llamasoft LTD"],"publishers":["Llamasoft LTD"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1266796800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/imxmgdtqkf7frd95gess.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":15229,"name":"Grand Prix 500 cc","summary":null,"genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Microids"],"publishers":["Microids"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536371200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbnzlysfdrjgx4wljcua.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"11856","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-11856/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10884","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Grand%20Prix%20500%20cc"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"UCSY4dk1p5j2PmEQ6ub6LXfQ","url":"https://gaming.youtube.com/game/UCSY4dk1p5j2PmEQ6ub6LXfQ"}]},{"igdb_id":15475,"name":"Greg LeMond's Bicycle Adventure","summary":"To cycling enthusiasts everywhere!\n\nPrepare to go on the bike ride of all time.\nThese diskettes contain a Knowledge Adventure Interactive Book produced by Eden Interactive.

The player's car can easily outpace the other cars, but if it collides with one, its speed drops lower than that of the impacted car. Driving over an oil slick causes the player's car to skid slightly sideways, but does not slow it down. Once every scale mile, the player crosses a narrow bridge over blue water.

In Grim Legions, you control units that move around the map trying to capture towns. Each turn, the towns recruit more units. The aim of the game is simply to wipe out your enemy (destroy all their troops and capture all their towns). There can be up to 4 players, and you can make alliances with other players.\n\nThere are three different types of troop: infantry, archers and cavalry. There's not much difference between these types, archers are just better than infantry, and cavalry better than archers. Unlike a lot of other games, you can combine multiple troop types in one unit (or \"legion\"), and you can split and merge them as much as you like.\n\nMap generation is randomized, but you have a lot of control over it. E.g. if you get sick of your units taking ages to move through the mountains, you can just generate a map without mountains. You can also decide how much of the map you want to be water (which no troops can move through), from 0% to 60%. There are also 3 map sizes to choose from. This means - despite the relatively simple gameplay - there are quite a few different scenarios. You can end up spending a lot more time playing this game than you think!\n\nGrim Legions is currently in open beta.

Unfortunately Blabgor is not a safe place; there are hordes of beasts roaming the landscape, eagerly searching for vulnerable Gribblets.\n\nThe basic premise for the game required the player to control Gribbly and navigate him through each of the 16 surreal 8-way scrolling landscapes in an attempt to locate and rescue eight baby Gribblets and returning them to the safety of the home cave. Gribbly can hop and levitate around each of the levels and can blow bubbles to defend himself. Once a Gribblet is located, Gribbly can pick up the hapless offspring and carry it to safety. Once only a single Gribblet remains on a level, the energy web fails, freeing Seon. This usually results in a mad rush to get the remaining Gribblet to safety before succumbing to his attacks. Once all the Gribblets are either saved or killed, the level ends and Gribbly is transported to the next level.","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Graftgold"],"publishers":["Hewson Consultants"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cwqxrgc2scmq9o3rfjdx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":28503,"name":"Grow","summary":"Grow is a Flash-based puzzle game created by On Nakayama.

You aren't the dumb schmuck who actually flies into battle and gets lazered. Leave that to those patriotic and keen young dudes from the outer-colonies. Nope, your job is as supreme commander in chief. Sit back at fleet HQ and watch the fireworks as you reduce the enemy to space-dust.\n\nUsing it's amazingly asynchronous multiplayer online 'challenge' system, GSB2 lets you put together a whole fleet and upload it, orders, formations and custom ship designs in one, up to a server where fellow GSB2 players can download it and pit their own fleets against it in glorious combat.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Positech Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1429142400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w4jqhnvja7g6eiuvxayg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":36014,"name":"Grand Class Melee 2","summary":"GCM2 is fierce arena combat with an RPG job system for 1-4 local players.

Furthermore, it has a stunning amount of levels on varying themes, more of which could be created with the level editor (available to registered users). \n \nThe different levels of GF2 are split up into themes such as Grass Worlds, Lego Worlds, Slime Worlds and Boring Worlds. Each player starts out on his home base with a fully loaded ship. The objective is simply to destroy the player by any means possible, be they to simply shoot him down, bomb him or to ram him into a wall, thereby depleting his shields. If your shields, fuel or ammunition is running low, you must return to your (or even you opponent's) base to refuel. However, landing makes you vulnerable to enemy bombardments. \n \nApart from the plain dogfighting levels, GF2 also offers a large amount of race levels, where the players race around a maze-like level where they must pass check points. Flying your ship around these levels is not as easy as it may seem, since you must fight gravity, just as in Thrust, but unlike Asteroids. \n \nGF2 was part, if not the progenitor, of the cave-flying trend that hit the Amiga in the mid-nineties, alongside games such as Bratwurst or Turboraketti.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Bits Productions"],"publishers":["Bits Productions"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":773020800,"platforms":["Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ocso3mobuj3tkyswva9v.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"821","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Gravity%20Force%202"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"896","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-896/"}]},{"igdb_id":37243,"name":"Gravity Force","summary":"Gravity Force is a game of dexterity.

This was bogus; when the Intellivision III wasn't ready to be shown at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, regular Intellivision screens with particularly nice graphics were passed off as examples of the forthcoming system. Grid Shock was one of these; color packaging was even printed up for it. \n \nAfter C.E.S., Andy never had a chance to return to the game.

Players had to skim surfaces of the planets and destroy all the bunkers therein, as well as beam up fuel cells to maintain their fuel level(s) and avoiding or destroying saucers that would also appear. The game did not do very well commercially and would only be ported to the Atari 2600 a few years later (although it has reappeared on some modern day compilations since). \n \nGravitrex is a clone of Gravitar, although with many differences, such as the addition of humans dotting the planetary landscapes that have to be rescued, and the Gravitrex Plus cart also includes two bonus games and other features as well. All games are for one player only. \n \nGameplay: \n \nThe player controls a fighter ship that begins each game in a solar system. There is a sun in the middle and several planets to choose from to enter so the player can start their mission. If the player takes too long with choosing a planet, a pair of space saucers will emerge from the reactor planet and will engage the player in a dogfight if they get close enough (although the player can just elude them by entering a planet). If the player’s ship gets destroyed or the player shoots both saucers then the player will return to the main solar system screen. \nOnce the player enters a planet by thrusting into it, they must destroy every enemy bunker on the surface and dispose of every fuel tank and human. Humans and fuel tanks can be shot (although the player will not receive any points for doing so), but a bonus is given if all humans are rescued on a level (see Scoring and Extras sections), plus fuel tanks are needed to keep up the player’s fuel level (which is indicated by a line right next to the score at the top left of the screen). Humans and fuel tanks can be teleported into the player’s ship by maneuvering their ship close and activating the teleporter/shields function. Once all bunkers have been destroyed and all humans and fuel tanks have been disposed of, a sound effect will signal that the mission is complete, and upon leaving the planet, it will self-destruct and the player will be given a bonus for that planet. \n \nThe exception to this rule is the lone reactor planet on each level, which has only one target – a reactor – deep inside it. This planet is different than all the others, as the player is given 99 time units to make their way through a brief maze, shoot the reactor, and get out before time runs out or else the player’s ship will be destroyed and the reactor will remain intact. If the player does not destroy this planet last in a level then it clears out the space saucers for the remainder of the level, since this is the planet that they emerge from. \n \nDangers include the player’s ship crashing if it runs out of fuel, plus the ship will be destroyed if shot by a bunker, space saucer or alien air interceptor (which are similar to space saucers but they appear inside a planet), if they crash into a wall, the sun, space saucer or alien air interceptor, or do not leave the reactor planet before their time runs out. If the player runs out of reserve ships then the game will end. The player’s fuel, however, is replenished mostly from a fuel tank and is fully replaced upon destroying a planet, finishing a level, or with each new ship. The player’s teleporter function also doubles as a shield to protect them from enemy fire. Also, if the player defeats all planets in a level, then that level’s sun will go nova, various bonuses are then awarded (see Extras section), and if the player defeats the third level the game will end, giving a congratulations message as well as sharing some trivia about Gravitrex from the game’s programmer John Dondzila on the screen.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1012521600,"platforms":["Vectrex"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1191599422","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Gravitrex"}]},{"igdb_id":46672,"name":"Great Basketball","summary":"This is basketball at the professional level.

Unlike other games of the interactive movie genre, which generally display the movie bits using pre-rendered full motion video, this game renders 3D models of the movie in real time.\n\nThe science fiction story of this movie/game follows a group of employees of the interplanetary mining corporation Miller-Western. For a variety of disciplinary reasons, the employees are sent to the Jupiter moon of Ganymede which used to have a thriving osmium-mining operation but is now just a dumping ground for problematic employees who assault their bosses or engineer faulty equipment because they were drunk. No one on the base is to be trusted, everyone is hiding a bevy of secrets and to make matters worse, every monitor across the moon base periodically picks up mysterious transmissions that appear to depict some unknown alien lifeform.

In 1942, special German forces have invaded Tibet and are searching for more to add to their Führer's arsenal - the 12 \"miracle\" weapons of King Arunja in an undiscovered \"Lost City\". One of these weapons, according to legend, could obliterate major cities, wiping them off the face of the earth. The player takes the part of Colonel Grom, a member of the Polish army fighting the Nazis during World War II. Grom is a seasoned and shrewd commander who has his own personal score to settle with the Germans.\n\nGROM: Terror in Tibet is a predominantly role-playing game with elements of stealth and emphasis on tactical combat. The player controls a party of characters, navigating them through towns and other locations in a fairly linear fashion, often engaging in conversations with multiple dialogue choices. Travelling between the various locations is handled by way of a country map. Combat system has similarities to that of Baldur's Gate, with real-time management and the ability to pause in order to issue commands. Unlike in most RPGs, the characters themselves do not level up in this game; their only growing attribute is weapon proficiency, which plays an important role in combat.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["Rebelmind"],"publishers":["cdv Software Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1038182400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ov3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10303","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-10303/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"9451","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Grom:%20Terror%20in%20Tibet"}]},{"igdb_id":73821,"name":"Great Naval Battles Vol. II: Guadalcanal 1942-43","summary":null,"genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co955s.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"9118","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Great%20Naval%20Battles%20Vol.%20II%3A%20Guadalcanal%201942-43"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"9944","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-9944/"}]},{"igdb_id":73909,"name":"Griel's Quest for the Sangraal","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qzmkbrfxybkoz8wy9dwl.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"8401","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Griel's%20Quest%20for%20the%20Sangraal"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"9166","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-9166/"}]},{"igdb_id":74004,"name":"Grand Slam Bridge II","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725760000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":74119,"name":"Greedy Trolley","summary":"\"Greedy Trolley\" is a platform video game.

The link to the download was pulled from the site on August 8, 2006. The game was subsequently released on a German website dedicated to Flash and freeware games and is available for Windows, OS X and Linux.\n\nUnlike Geometry Wars which eventually plateaus in difficulty facilitating high scores in the range of hundreds of millions of points, GridWars 2 has an exponentially increasing difficulty curve. Eventually, the enemy spawn sites become so large that they nearly envelop the entire grid.\n\nAnother important difference from Geometry Wars is the ability to \"farm\" black holes. Besides distracting and swallowing enemies, the black holes can net points (and thus bombs/lives) based on the square of the number of enemies they have swallowed.","genres":[],"developers":["Blitzmax"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1135123200,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":93106,"name":"Grand Ouvert","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"10821","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Grand%20Ouvert"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"11788","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-11788/"}]},{"igdb_id":93203,"name":"Grid Run and Pontoon","summary":"Grid Run and Pontoon is a compilation featuring two distinct games:\n\nGrid Run is an action-packed maze game reminiscent of classic arcade titles.

The twelve numbers engraved on the Chronos Gauge are the key to victory!\n\nVedley, who lost his parents in a sad incident, hears from Achieitz about the existence of the Letoiles, who are able to make any wish come true.\nIn order to turn back time and try to save his parents, Vedley makes a pact with a Letoile and becomes her Maschelle, and they throw themselves into the battles to steal Sertzes from the other Letoiles.\n\nControl time, baffle enemies, and turn the course of battles! After all the ferocious fighting... What awaits Vedley?\n\nSkill Gems have many different powers, and when fitted into a Skill Plate, a Gem makes it possible for a character to use magic or a skill.\nBy combining Gems, characters may also be able to use special skills.\nAlso, by flicking a Skill Plate, it can be rotated, and it is easy to change the positions of skills already fitted directly corresponding to the Chronos Gauge.\n\nThe outcome of every battle comes down to the tactics you choose!\nDuring battles, the character icons are shown on the left-hand side of the screen, and next to them, a range of effects are sometimes displayed.\nThese are known as Field Effects, and if a character’s turn comes while one of those effects is shown next to their icon, the character can gain the benefits of that effect.\nHowever, Field Effects are not always advantageous. There are also disadvantageous effects. Also, effects apply to apply to both enemies and allies. However, by raising the level of the Chronos Gauge to 100% or more, you can launch Interrupt Actions. When an advantageous effect is attached to an enemy, or when a disadvantageous effect is attached to an ally, you can use an Interrupt Action to change the order of the characters' actions, and avoid these unfavorable situations.\n\nThe Chronos Gauge holds the key to victory!\nThe Chronos Gauge is necessary for characters to be able to use the Particular Skills they each have, or to be able to launch Interrupt Actions, with which the order of the characters' actions can be changed. The Gauge has a display like a clock, with the numbers 1 to 12, and at the start of a battle one of the numbers will glow. The glowing number will move clockwise each time an ally or enemy performs an action. At this time, if you use a skill corresponding to the glowing number, a Just Time Bonus will be triggered, and the level of the Gauge will recover by a large amount. Also, the level of the Gauge increases, although only by a little, when enemies are defeated.\n\nThe Gauge is shared across all party members, so it's a good idea to pay attention to the level as you use Particular Skills and launch Interrupt Actions!","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Magitec"],"publishers":["Kemco"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1398902400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7hc9.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2495620","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2495620"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"9N060Z8B3BNF","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/-1-/9N060Z8B3BNF"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10008963","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008963"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"31640931","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Grace%20of%20Letoile"}]},{"igdb_id":118337,"name":"Grim Tales: The Vengeance - Collector's Edition","summary":"When his sister is murdered, you must prove your nephew’s innocence!","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Elephant Games"],"publishers":["Activision","Big Fish Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1400112000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaj36.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":118604,"name":"Gregor Hills Haunted Hospital","summary":"Gregor Hills Haunted Hospital is a Top Down survival horror game based on the story of one of the most Haunted hospitals located in Gregor Hills.","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1559865600,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co41gt.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"462636657","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Gregor%20Hills%20Haunted%20Hospital"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1084770","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1084770"}]},{"igdb_id":118751,"name":"Great Artists Steal","summary":"Handprint Games is collaborating with a local artist, SCR1BBLE, to create a beautiful new hand-drawn indie game: Great Artists Steal.\n\n'Great Artists Steal' is a hand-drawn platformer in which you play a scribbled character in a 2-dimensional scribbled world, trying to steal famous masterpieces.

To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given a new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm. No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun?\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 02\nA VIP arriving from abroad mysteriously disappears in transit. The SORD team at Mihama Academy is presented with a new mission: finding and recovering him. Whenever they appear to be closing in on this missing \"package\", though, it somehow slips through their fingers. Accompanying them on their mission are two fellow SORD from the Kyousen Sakuragaoka campus - twin sisters, who both help and hinder the crew. There have also been rumors floating around of a daredevil biker named \"Soul Speed\", who tears up the streets at night. Before long, the team's thrilling chase descends into a deathmatch, pushing the combatants to their limits and beyond. Rena and Haruto, meanwhile, are taken on a journey deep into the past, to their first-ever encounter.\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 03\nWhile Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip. Within moments of their arrival, though, the Mihama gang are pulled into a manhunt for a SORD deserter, assisted by students Sylvia and Velvet of St. Aile's International School. Tohka's the star of the show this time round, but she's wrestling with her own issues - old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep...\n“You're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.”\n“Let's meet up again someday... if we're still alive.”\nAnd introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's:\n“If taking her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I simply want to see this mess cleaned up.”\nWhat answers will Tohka find?\nShe has the truth in her sights...\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 04\nKumashiro Megumi (Gumi), recently transferred from St. Aile's International School, has been training hard together with Rena and Maki – now fully recovered from their injuries. With the help of her mentor, Tohka, she's shaping up to be a fine sniper.\nJust as one new student settles in, another has her sights set on joining the girls in Class A, Mihama's elite combat unit. Her name? Sengoku Taiga. Haruto, the team's handler, has one condition for Taiga's transfer: that Chris serves as her supervising officer.\nThe two seem an unlikely pair at first, but after spending some time with little Taiga, Chris soon finds a way to see things from her perspective.\nIt's at that moment that the nation is suddenly rocked by a terror attack on an unprecedented scale. Chris rushes to the scene, aware of what's at stake, but paying no heed to the dangers ahead.\nJust as she did, once before.\n\"This is even worse than we could've imagined...\"\nThe death toll keeps on rising, but SORD are stuck watching helplessly from the sidelines. What destiny awaits Chris, Taiga... and Mihama Academy?\n\"Oh, right... I must have died...\"\nClutching to memories of her long-dead mother, she too prepares for an eternity of slumber...\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 05\nA few weeks have passed since SORD successfully resolved the Kitaoka University terrorist incident - albeit with some sacrifices - when Murasaki's older sister Yuuki returns to Japan and returns to Mihama Academy.\nBeing more sociable and capable than her sister, Yuuki immediately befriends the other students and builds a trusting relationship with them.\n\"There's no reason for me to be at Mihama anymore...\"\nAs Murasaki starts questioning her raison d'etre, she reminisces about the time when she first met Haruto.\nA few years earlier...\nLamenting his lack of experience, he had come to her village hidden deep in the mountains in search of new skills.\nHe got to know the Ikoma sisters better and kept up with his training. As he seeks out the village's \"secret art\", a sudden tragedy befalls them.\n\"I'll never forgive you...!!\"\n\"It's okay... Don't worry... I'm not... going anywhere... I'm here with you...\"\n\"I'm stumped... It's exactly as she said - and there's no way to cut a phantom...\"\n\"Come on. Chin up...

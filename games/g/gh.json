There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths, and weaknesses. As the game develops the characters themselves will develop and grow. What's more, each one has its own unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood while others can cut the lights in the room...Each time you scare a human or 'mortal', you will increase your plasm; the energy you need to scare them in the first place. Scare them too much and people will flee from the building, which will make your job more difficult.Ghost Master uses a unique AI engine, which gives the player a sense of natural human behaviour. The mortals will go about their everyday lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with each other... until they encounter the horrors you control!

It was in development by Data East and planned to be published by SNK for the Neo Geo MVS (arcade), Neo Geo AES (home) and Neo Geo CD.\n\nYou aim shots the same way as in Puzzle Bobble, but there are only two main colors of bubbles to destroy--or in this case ghosts. The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch.\n\nThe action is fast-paced and smooth. The lighthearted characters and rockabilly music add a lot of charm that is missing from newer puzzle games like Lumines and Planet Puzzle League.\n\nIn February 2003, a MVS prototype cartridge of Ghostlop was acquired by video game collector Billy Pitt from an Ohio-based arcade operator, who received it via SNK. Around the same time period, a ROM image of the complete game was leaked online by homebrew developer Neobitz.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Data East"],"publishers":["SNK"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Neo Geo AES","Arcade","Neo Geo CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coalbp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":41139,"name":"Ghosts'n Goblins Arcade","summary":"Unofficial remake of the arcade version of Ghosts'n Goblins for Commodore C64.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1437436800,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4a0k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"981780194","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ghosts'n%20Goblins%20Arcade"}]},{"igdb_id":42612,"name":"Ghoul Patrol","summary":"In the sequel to Zombies Ate My Neighbors you as the kids - Zeke or/and Julie - have to save the world from demon the lord of skeletons, ghouls, ghosts and etc. Shooting them by super-new weapons like Plasma Gun or Lobbing Smash Gun, you need to rescue ten trapped victims on each level and fight the boss at the end.

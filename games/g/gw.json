Famously, the game was made over the course of an hour with the entire development team being held at gunpoint. The resulting game singlehandedly caused the video game crash of 1983. In a quick effort to hide this failure, the character of ET was created as a scapegoat. During the video game crash of 1984, Gwimbly's original company was forced to sell most of its assets, including Gwimbly. The IP was then bought up by Insane Groundbreaking Games. This new studio would go on to create the most well-known games in the series. Until recently, the Gwimbly franchise has remained dormant until his recent addition to the Super Smashing Fighters series. I decided to port the first Gwimbly game to preserve it for both old and new fans.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9khs.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":30,"store":"itch","uid":"2630168","url":"https://moth-entertainment.itch.io/gwimbly"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"668622749","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Gwimbly%202600"}]},{"igdb_id":340406,"name":"GwenBlade 2: Halloween","summary":"MAKE DEMONS LOSE THEIR S#^T in Roguelike Horror Action when you combo them in quick succession!

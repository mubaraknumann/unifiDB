The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco Limited"],"publishers":["Midway","Namco Limited","Dempa Shimbunsha"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":368150400,"platforms":["Arcade","PC-9800 Series","Sharp X1","FM-7","Xbox 360","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6njq.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258410812","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/GALAGA/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258410812"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"15784","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15784/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"14476","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Galaga"}]},{"igdb_id":3129,"name":"Gain Ground","summary":"In Gain Ground, players control one of a set of characters at a time.

Each character has his or her own unique strength and weaknesses. For example, the Warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the Wizard has the most powerful magic, the Valkyrie has the best armour and the Elf is the fastest in movement.\n\nUpon selecting a playable character, the gameplay is set within a series of top-down, third-person perspective mazes where the object is to find and touch the designated exit in every level. An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase player's character's health, unlock doors, gain more points and magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen.\nThe enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers and thieves. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no bosses in the game, the most dangerous enemy is \"Death\", who can not only drain a character's health, but is difficult to destroy.\nAs the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently. While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, it also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies. The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game credit (i.e. inserting a coin) within a certain short time window after it died.

The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; each player is differentiated by color. Thus, instead of having a \"warrior\", \"wizard\", and \"valkyrie\" (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a \"red wizard\", a \"blue elf\" and a \"green warrior\".\n\nIn addition to the new \"class\" system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features included the enemy \"It\", which upon contact would make a player \"It\" and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy.\n\nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits.\n\nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don't be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).\n\nThis sequel was also the first to feature what is now known as the Gauntlet theme tune, which resembles a simplified Baroque fugue.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Atari Games"],"publishers":["U.S. Gold","Atari Games","Mindscape, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504921600,"platforms":["Arcade","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9hfl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":3926,"name":"Gakuen Toshi Vara Noir","summary":"The threat of demonic invasion gives impetus to the fledgling Simba Empire to found a school of magic called Vara Noir.

It was followed by a successful sequel called Galaga in 1981 and two less known sequels called Gaplus in 1984 and Galaga '88 in 1987. Galaxian was one of the most popular games in the golden age of arcade video games.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Midway","Namco"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":306201600,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27k5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":4866,"name":"Gadget and the Gadgetinis","summary":"An Europe-exclusive PS2 game based on the animated show of the same name (itself a spin-off of the mid-'80s Inspector Gadget series).","genres":[],"developers":["KO Software"],"publishers":["Hip Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1099612800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zsfpcrpgyunijbvg71xj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":4880,"name":"Game Party","summary":"Game Party allows you to play 5 different games on one cartridge.

The gateway guns allow you to place two gateways on the walls, floors and ceilings of the lab so that when you pass through one you emerge out of the other. As progress is made through the game different types of gateway gun are introduced with different effects. After the basic gun, you acquire a gun that creates two gateways of different sizes, passing through one way shrinks Ed to half his size and the other way makes Ed grow to twice his size. Then you find a gun where one gateway doesn't just connect to the others location but also its time, allowing Ed to travel back in time and encounter earlier versions of himself. Finally, the last gun manipulates gravity so passing through allows Ed to walk along walls and on ceilings.\n\nGateways takes place on a single sprawling map rammed with puzzles and challenges. As power ups are acquired more and more of the map opens up containing more power ups and secrets. In addition to the gateway guns Ed will also find a torch letting him light up the darker areas of the map and a mirror which can be used to deflect lasers.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Smudged Cat Games"],"publishers":["Smudged Cat Games"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1347494400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25cn.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1207659733","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/gateways"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"216290","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/216290"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"66250","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Gateways"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"38873","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-38873/"}]},{"igdb_id":13719,"name":"Galaforce","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["BBC Microcomputer System"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"821385121","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Galaforce"}]},{"igdb_id":13720,"name":"Gateway to Karos","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["BBC Microcomputer System"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2104012732","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Gateway%20to%20Karos"}]},{"igdb_id":13854,"name":"Game Over","summary":"Queen Gremla rules over five confederations of planets thanks to a powerful army of Terminators led by Arkos, her most faithful servant, until the queen's contempt caused her to go over to the enemy army led by McKiller.\n\nThe game is divided into three phases, in the first one Arkos must face the Terminators on the planet Hypsis, from where Gremla obtains the raw materials.

The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).\n\nWith the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement \"That's Galactic Dancin'!\" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a \"secret bonus\" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the \"special bonus\" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.\n\nGalaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a \"Warp Capsule\".\n\nAt the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the \"continue\" option to \"on\", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco","Namco"],"publishers":["Micomsoft","Namco","Namco Bandai Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":565315200,"platforms":["Arcade","Sharp X68000","Wii","Sega Game Gear","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2pol.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":15934,"name":"Gargoyle's Quest","summary":"Gargoyle's Quest Brings Big-Screen Action to Game Boy!\n\nYou are Firebrand - gargoyle and proud guardian of the Ghoul Realm.

Sasaki went by the fighting name of Ganryū, hence the game's name \"Ganryu Musashi\".\n\nThe game's selectable characters are the samurai swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and his female kunoichi counterpart Suzume. The mission of the game is to rescue Musashi's love Otsu from a clan of evil ninja led by Kojiro Sasaki. Players are armed with a sword (katana for Musashi/kaiken for Suzume) and a grappling claw. The claw serves as a long-range weapon, and can act as a grapnel in certain settings to reach higher ground or ascend over chasms. A powerful projectile attack can also be achieved by holding down the attack button, although this takes time to charge. Additional temporary weapons can be found throughout the game, such as shuriken for Musashi, kunai for Suzume, and an \"energy ball\" weapon. Upon rescuing hostages, rewards are given to the player in form of food (onigiri, takoyaki), which can restore health, or ryo coins for extra points.","genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Visco"],"publishers":["Visco","SNK"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":915148800,"platforms":["Neo Geo AES","Arcade","Neo Geo MVS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/syjxojnda6h4lamw7abm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"12644","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-12644/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"11616","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ganryu"}]},{"igdb_id":39990,"name":"Galaxy Wars","summary":"The aim of this arcade game is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top.

Some other features introduced in Galactic Warriors that were used in later fighting games include block damage, air-blocking, the ability to shoot/throw projectiles, the ability to execute multiple attacks while airborne, a modern health bar (as opposed to a health meter with notches like in Capcom's Mega Man series that made their debut two years later), the ability to switch between armed and unarmed and attacks of varying levels of strength.\n\nAnother feature introduced at the time allows the player to choose one of three Mechas, each with their own movesets: Samson, Gaea and Poseidon. When one is selected, the player must use it to destroy other robots in each planet. Other than the playable characters, there are several non-playable characters and bosses with original designs and unique movesets. In the final battle, the player will face the same character he or she chose. After defeating the final opponent, the game goes back to the beginning and the player's chosen character and the opponents will have an extra weapon.\n\nUnlike in the single player modes of other fighting games, Galactic Warriors lacks continues and gives the player a number of lives similar to ones in some other genres from platform games to beat 'em ups. When the player loses all of his or her lives, the game is over and it returns to attract mode. In each battle, the timer starts at one minute and thirty seconds, and when it drops to zero before any player is knocked out, the player with the least amount of damage wins. Players can monitor this by looking at their life bars. At the start of the fight, both players life bars are blue, but as the fight progresses, the life bar changes to a pink color for the player with the least amount of health remaining or most damage taken. Therefore, if a player's life bar is pink when/if time runs out, that player will lose.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":499651200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co965w.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"32769","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-32769/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"29489","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Galactic%20Warriors"}]},{"igdb_id":40140,"name":"Garuka","summary":"AKA Devastators.

The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work.\n\nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage.\n\nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level.\n\nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish.\n\nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing.\n\nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel).\n\nA mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live.\n\nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair.\n\nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2's track almost sounds as if it's been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It's eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo's King's Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King's Field I Arrange Collection.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Techno Soleil"],"publishers":["HAMSTER","Sony Computer Entertainment","Techno Soleil"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":850435200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co60qu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"29478","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/GaiaSeed:%20Project%20Seed%20Trap"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"32758","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-32758/"}]},{"igdb_id":43774,"name":"Galaxian3","summary":"A home version of the arcade game of the same name, Galaxian 3 allows up to four players to blast away at oncoming enemy fighters from a first-person perspective.

SNK Playmore returned the sentiments by placing Makoto Mizoguchi in KOF: Maximum Impact Regulation \"A\".\n\nUnlike their game of origins, this title is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Players travel the world looking for either Geese or Karnov. Fighting is like other games in the genre with the exception of the three-bar super gauge at the bottom of the screen, allowing players to perform their character's special or desperation moves. The computer can also use their special techniques and aren't given a particular limit. Plane switching from the Fatal Fury series is kept intact and serves as the dodge/block for this game.

GalCiv II focuses on the single player experience that consists of a Campaign mode and a \"Sandbox\" mode, and omits multi-player. The game is notable for its artificial intelligence, which is challenging without being given resources and abilities not available to the player, as is common in the majority of strategy games.\n\nGalactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar is the first expansion pack to the turn-based strategy game Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords. It added new features such as: Two new civilizations: a genocidal Drengin offshoot called the Korath and a civilization called the Krynn, A new campaign in which the player leads the Drengin Empire, The ability to create custom opponents, An \"environment\" statistic to planets, which will determine which civilization can innately colonize or what technologies will be necessary for other civilizations to colonize different planets, An enhanced role for espionage, special \"Agents\" being hired that can conduct various missions, such as sabotage or destabilization, on rival worlds, or act as counter-agents against rival agents attempting to conduct missions on the player's worlds, Asteroid fields to the space map, for players to mine for resources. Resources from asteroid fields are directed to planets where they increase manufacturing capacity, A great deal of new ship hulls and jewellery and The extermination of two civilizations during the campaign - the two exterminated civilizations will still be available in \"sandbox\" mode, but will not appear in the future releases of the game.\n\nGalactic Civilizations II: Twilight of the Arnor is the second expansion pack to the turn-based strategy video game Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords. It added new features such as: The ability to destroy solar systems with massive ships called \"Terror Stars\", Unique technology trees, planetary improvements, and weapons for each civilization, A map pointer and custom scenario editor, New graphics that reduce graphic memory requirements by over 90% and a new map size that allows for games that may take millennia to complete\n\nThe officially supported Community Update, included in all recent releases of Ultimate Edition, fixes severe bugs in the AI that were present in Twilight of the Arnor.","genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1322784000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3drh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":155080,"name":"Galactic Civilizations III: Worlds in Crisis","summary":"In Worlds in Crisis, you will encounter a host of new world events with ideological choices that you will have to resolve.

Within net/new media art the techno-filter extends these straight lines into exacting geometries and smooth bit rates, the personal as WYSIWYG buttons. This game/artwork, while forever attached to these belief/design systems, attempts to re-introduce the hand-drawn, the messy and illogical, the human and personal creation into the digital, via a retro-game style interface, Hovering above and attached to the poorly drawn aesthetic is a personal examination of how we/I continually switch and un-switch our dominant belief systems. Moving from levels themed for faith or real estate, for chemistry or capitalism, the user triggers corrected poetry, jittering creatures and death and deathless noises. In addition each level contains short videos from the artist's childhood, representing those brief young interactions which spark out eventual beliefs.

There are also turn-based battles, during which the player has to choose the right attacks at the right time to defeat the opponents. There are also a few mini-games that appear during the course of the game, such as a quiz show and a slot machine-type game with the purpose of getting new clothes for Yuna.

The remaining population resides in the last \"green\" city, a sanctuary shielded from the desolate wastelands that cover the rest of the planet.\n\nTo select the most skilled and resourceful individuals for a crucial space mission, the city's leaders organize an intense competition known as the \"Galactic Gauntlet: The Ultimate Interstellar Challenge.\" This competition consists of a series of grueling obstacle courses designed to test the physical abilities, problem-solving skills, and mental fortitude of the participants.\n\nAs a promising candidate, you enter the Galactic Gauntlet, aiming to prove yourself worthy of joining the elite team of explorers who will embark on the interstellar journey to find a new home for humanity. The obstacle courses are not only physically demanding but also simulate the challenges and dangers that await in space, such as zero gravity zones, asteroid fields, and complex puzzles.\n\nThroughout the competition, you'll face fierce rivals, uncover hidden secrets about the mission, and make critical choices that will determine your fate and the fate of humanity. Only the most skilled and resilient will earn a place on the space mission, where they will venture into the unknown to secure a future for mankind.\n\nIn this intense competition, players will navigate through treacherous obstacle courses, each designed to test their agility and quick-thinking. You'll need to dodge, jump, and strategize your way past various hazards that threaten to send you back to the last checkpoint you passed. Your ultimate goal? To ascend the leaderboards, outpace your rivals, and etch your name in the annals of the Galactic Gauntlet as the fastest, most cunning competitor in this ultimate interstellar challenge. With each run, you'll hone your skills, learn the nuances of each course, and strive for that flawless run that will secure your place among the stars.\n\nThe game's controls are designed to be intuitive and responsive, giving players a sense of agility and precision as they navigate the courses.

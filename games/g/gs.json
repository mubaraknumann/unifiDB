It also features \"Trackman\", a mode which allows players to create their own tracks using various objects. Tutorials guide the player to this mode. A two-player split screen mode is included in the game, as well as the Time Trial and Cup racing modes for one player. The player should choose a craft they like to use in the game, and then go through five series (each including six tracks). After the race has loaded, the screen will show a view of the track. The player will see a countdown that would begin the race. The player must finish at first, second or third place to win. If he or she successfully completed a series, the player unlocks more material. Despite the tracks incorporating twists, turns, loops, corkscrews and jumps, various obstacles are considered avoidable for him or her. Falling off the track is one example. When below the third position, he or she will lose. In addition, there are the boost and health icons throughout each track.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1046390400,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fe0bpoqljuoezoh5dpvm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":66587,"name":"G-Saviour","summary":"A mecha action game based on the live-action movie of the same name.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Sunrise Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":968889600,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6269.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"31330","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-31330/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"28209","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/G-Saviour"}]},{"igdb_id":83425,"name":"G-Stream G2020","summary":"A 2002 shoot-'em-up from Triangle Service and Oriental Soft.

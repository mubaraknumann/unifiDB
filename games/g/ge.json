The Amahagane are sacred jewels which grant the owners godlike powers, such as Kamui. Now, rumors are spreading of new, ungodly creatures fighting with Heishi warriors, even without the powers of Amahagane. Yoshitsune and his companions must draw their weapons again, and with the new strength given to them by the Amahagane, defeat the new evil to save all of Japan.\n\nGenji: Days of the Blade, sequel to the PlayStation 2 game Genji: Dawn of the Samurai, is an action game, based in ancient/feudal Japan, in which you must defeat a new, mysterious source of evil to save your country. You control one of four characters (changeable in real-time), each with their own weapons, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nYoshitsune Minamoto and Benkei Musashibo, the main characters of the previous game, join with Gozen Shizuka and Lord Buson to complete their quest. Yoshitsune is a young warrior who wields a katana in each hand, Benkei is a mighty warrior-monk who uses a war club and a naginata for weapons. Shizuka is a nimble priestess who is adept with chained blades, and Buson is a God of War from the Overworld who carries a double saber and can use supernatural powers.\n\nThe game play involves fighting many enemies and bosses with regular attacks, combo attacks, and Kamui. Kamui is a power that you can use to summon a magical space around you in which you unleash multiple special attacks on surrounding enemies by pressing buttons in series as they appear on the screen. Your Kamui bar fills as you land successful hits on opponents. The characters travel through both levels based on real locations in Japan and fantasy locations, defeating everything from regular Heishi warriors to giant, mutated enemy crabs. The level design involves platformer elements and solving small puzzles, such as destroying Masho flowers scattered throughout an area to open a door.\n\nThe game also has RPG elements; you collect Amahagane and Mashogane hidden around levels and from fallen enemies. They can be used to augment character stats and weapon attack power, respectively. You can also find new weapons and items such as herbs with healing properties, or scrolls that give you attack bonuses for a period of time.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Game Republic Inc."],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":55.0,"release_date":1163203200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2902.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"15569","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15569/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"14281","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Genji: Days of the Blade"}]},{"igdb_id":7350,"name":"Get Even","summary":"\"Take a deep breath...\" Try to remember: a girl, a chair, a bomb.

Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.\n\nSince the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them.\n\nA behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Epic Games"],"publishers":["Microsoft Game Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1166659200,"platforms":["Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5eye.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":47456,"name":"Gears of War 3: Epic Edition","summary":"The Epic Edition includes a Marcus Fenix statue, an artbook for the game, multiplayer skins for the game's five starting weapons, plus all the content of the Limited Edition (which includes an Octus Service Medal, an exclusive unlockable Adam Fenix multiplayer character, a fabric COG Flag, and the personal effects of Adam Fenix, including his \"Last Will and Testament\", the initial Hammer of Dawn schematic, and other Fenix family mementos.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1319068800,"platforms":["Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5eyj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":47465,"name":"Gears of War 2: Game of the Year Edition","summary":"Gears of War 2 is a 2008 military science fiction third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360.

The game was officially released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009.

The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \"Horde\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \"chainsaw duels\" and the ability to use downed foes as \"meatshields\" were added to the game.\n\nOn its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies.

It was based on the manga series GeGeGe no Kitaro. This game was followed by a sequel titled Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen, which was released the following year only in Japan also by Bandai. It was the eighth best selling Famicom game of 1986, selling 1,250,000 copies.\n\nThe original Japanese version is notably different from the American version (Ninja Kid). The main character is Kitarō, and his main weapon is his hair rather than darts. His sub-weapons are a flying finger instead of shuriken, his vest instead of the feather, and a geta instead of a boomerang. All of these weapons function the same as the ones of the protagonist of the American version, Kyo; they just use different sprites. The fireball sub-weapon remains the same. Certain levels are inhabited by \"western\" film monsters like Frankenstein's Monster and Count Dracula; the boss of these levels is the character Buckbaird, the leader of the \"western youkai\". The scroll which unlocks the fortress is a crystal ball in the original version. The familiars are also different, being characters from the manga: the Pegasus was originally Nurikabe, the Eagle was Konaki Jiji, and the Mirror was Sunakake Babaa. Finally, a few of the minor enemies are different; most notably the \"Pirate Ninja\" found in some of the Guerilla Warfare levels was originally Nezumi Otoko, and Kitaro rides on Ittan Momen during the Dog Fight levels.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Tose"],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":514080000,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8e8i.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"519412","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/GeGeGe%20no%20Kitaro:%20Yokai%20Daimakyou"}]},{"igdb_id":48484,"name":"Gekitotsu Yonku Battle","summary":"Gekitotsu Shiku Battle is a Japan-exclusive video game of the vehicular combat game genre released in 1989 by Irem for the Family Computer.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Irem"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":629856000,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wvfcdcfrvsohw1jqn49o.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"37087","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-37087/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"33268","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Gekitotsu%20Yonku%20Battle"}]},{"igdb_id":48485,"name":"GeGeGe no Kitaro 2: Yokai Gundan no Chousen","summary":"GeGeGe no Kitaro 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of GeGeGe no Kitaro: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.\n\nGeGeGe no Kitaro 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.\n\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Tose"],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567129600,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5y56.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"68082","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/GeGeGe%20no%20Kitaro%202:%20Yokai%20Gundan%20no%20Chousen"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"39833","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-39833/"}]},{"igdb_id":48579,"name":"General's Son","summary":"The General's Son (Janggun ui adeul) is a 1-on-1 fighting game and based on the Korean gangster movie of the same name.

Other in-game times can be advanced by fiddling with the clock on the screen.\n\nInsects collected during the game may be viewed from the game title or from an illustrated book during the game. The total number of insects featured is 310, and sampling 200 of these insects is the ending. The collected insects can also be exchanged with other players via a link cable. At the beginning of the game, players are told that they have to catch 200 different insects in 30 days, but even after 30 days, no penalty such as game over is imposed.\n\nThe game cartridge is a vibrating cartridge equipped with a vibration function, and by setting AAA batteries in the cartridge, it will vibrate when an insect is caught, etc. Also included in the game software was an appendix 昆虫図鑑ミニブック( Insect Pictorial Book Minibook), which contained information on insects appearing in the game.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Jaleco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":934502400,"platforms":["Game Boy Color"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3c9n.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":154166,"name":"Gems of Magic: Father's Day","summary":"Remove all obstacles and reunite father and son in 100 challenging levels!

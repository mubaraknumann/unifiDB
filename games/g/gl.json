Thankfully, the GDF has also been developing new technology to fight them.\n\nGlobal Defence Force is a third-person action shooter. Choose from either an GDF infantryman or the flight-capable Pale Wing, each with different abilities and dozens of weapons each, and set out to shoot down hordes of giant insects, enormous robots, and UFOs of incredible scale. You can choose two weapons to carry for each mission, and pickups dropped by enemies will unlock new weapons and increase your character's maximum health. You can play the game split-screen cooperatively.\n\nBeyond adding a second player class to choose from; the Pale Wing; a fragile but powerful melee centric character with a limited Jetpack and her own weapon set, to go alongside the infantry man of the first game, Global Defence Force doesn't change much of the basic game play of Monster Attack. But leaving at that would undersell the game; there are numerous new alien types, weapons and environments that add much more variety to things. The maps are larger and more detailed and missions are longer and much more scripted (where as the original game nearly always threw you into an environment against some preplaced bug's, this time you often have some simple objective(s)) to add further variety. Finally the physics have been notably enhanced.\n\nLike Monster Attack, the player in Global Defence Force fights completely by themselves despite being part of an army (unless playing offline only 2 player split screen); the original Japanese version features radio chatter from other GDF squads and your commanding officer, to give the illusion that you are fighting alongside others. This was cut from the English release.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Sandlot"],"publishers":["D3 Publisher"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1122508800,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co49jt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":5582,"name":"Global Defence Force: Tactics","summary":"Players assume the role of GDF Commander and control GDF units in turn-based missions against the giant bug menace.

Color codes are also important for some enemies, as they may go about the color (they attack you when you don't match their color).\n\nIf you manage to collect five dewdrops of the same color in a row, you get the super-power and you can knock off or even out the most dangerous foe. The game consists of more then 70 levels spread over 5 different world (like Terrarium, Honey Garden, etc.) and offers 9 power-ups to help you get that far. And at the end of each world, you face a boss.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Nikitova"],"publishers":["WildTangent"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1135987200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8hnl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":70919,"name":"Glypha III","summary":"Glypha III is in many ways a clone of the arcade classic Joust, but features several innovations.\n\nAs in joust, your character flies through a fixed screen and must hit flying enemies while positioned higher than them in order to kill them.

Aliens once attacked Earth and now the humans travel to their planets to take the fight to their worlds. One of two players, working together, control a space ship in fixed-screen stages filled with blocks. To win a stage all blocks need to be removed and this done by moving over them. Meanwhile aliens spawn from different directions and roam around. Some of them can also fire while other have special abilities such as leaving behind bombs or restoring the blocks. The player's space ship can shoot bullets (now an unlimited amount unlike in Splash!), but not all enemies can be defeated. It is also possible to leave behind dynamite as a bomb or active a shield for temporary invincibility. Defeated opponents drop coins for extra points, additional bombs, a new primary weapon or energy to restore the shield.\n\nThe ship can be steered in eight directions and a single credit provides three lives. There is also a time limit per level. The game contains eight worlds with four stages each. The last stage is always a boss fight against a strong character and there are no blocks to clear. In addition the player is rewarded with a nude or revealing picture of a man or a woman. The picture is already teased after completing the first three levels, but with some black blocks covering parts. Only when the boss is defeated is the picture revealed in full. At the start of the game the player chooses between Boys mode or Girls mode to determine the gender of the people in the pictures.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["OMK Software"],"publishers":["Gaelco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3rkh.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"843441854","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Glass"}]},{"igdb_id":167557,"name":"Glizzy Gobbler","summary":"Made for meat-lovers!

It is a sound work composed with divination and AI, which manifests as both an immersive physical installation and videogame. The core of GLUT is a sound composition made entirely of Hedva’s voice, ranging from its rawest expression of screams, to two AI vocal clones that, in order to trick the surveillance tactics embedded in AI, have been manipulated to sound ever more de-human.\n\nDisturbed that proprietary vocal-clone software services reserve the right to sell client voice data to governments and corporations, Hedva worked with artist, musician, technologist, and writer Jessika Khazrik to deceive the software, training it with Hedva’s voice disguised through multiple vocoding processes. Hedva and Khazrik created two vocal clones: Arid and Mud, neither of which are made from an actual human voice and therefore not actual vocal clones. In GLUT, these two AI voices speak a text corpus that Hedva built over four lunar cycles, and synthesized through various divination techniques. The corpus is composed of the writings of medieval mystics (mostly of the apophatic tradition); theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers writing about black holes, dark matter, night, and nothingness; poets and novelists on sleep, music, and the voice; and the algorithm of amazon.com.\n\nIn the game, users are a teratoma avatar that drags itself through an environment cheating at non-Euclidean geometry through a series of nesting black holes, intestinal tunnels, glittering caves, and oceans of black water. It is a digital experience that mirrors the physical installation (shown at the HKW Berlin) while producing a world that disorients as much as it confirms what knowledges are available to the body.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1632268800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4hid.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":192518,"name":"Global Pandemic","summary":"Can you survive in a world with Zombies and Dinosaurs?

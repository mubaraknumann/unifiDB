When the upgrade has been purchased and installed, four additional lanes are installed. Multiplayer support is also enabled, allowing up to four players to bowl and keep track of their scores during a game.\n\nHyperBowl is similar to a basic game of ten-pin bowling: the goal is to knock down as many of the ten pins as possible within thirty seconds. Unlike in normal bowling, the lane also contains obstacles, like moving vehicles in the Tokyo and San Francisco lanes and trees in the Yosemite lane. The player can use a mouse or trackball to guide the ball while it's moving in order to avoid obstacles and aim for the pins. A clock at the upper-right corner of the lane window displays the time left to knock down pins. The game displays players' scores in a similar way to the displays found in traditional bowling alleys.

At the beginning of the game, players choose one of three characters: a human boy or girl, or an insect-like climber.\n\nEach has different levels of climbing speed and endurance (which measures how many hits they can take from falling objects before losing their grip). The basic gameplay of climbing structures is the same, though Hyper Crazy Climber has numerous different settings, including an abandoned clock tower, a misty mountain, and even a giant beanstalk, all rendered with some excellent foreground and background graphics.\n\nAll of these structures have convenient grids on them, analogous to the windows of the original Crazy Climber. Hyper Crazy Climber doesn't offer much of a chance to stop and drink in that nicely drawn scenery, though there are many new dangers, ranging from the original game's nuisance of people throwing objects, to deadly avalanches of large boulders which can dislodge the climber with a single hit.\n\nThe object of the game is to survive these various levels and settings to reach the final level with its prerequisite boss showdown. The original Crazy Climber is also included with the new version.","genres":[],"developers":["Nihon Bussan"],"publishers":["HAMSTER","Nihon Bussan","MonkeyPaw Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":825033600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coat5x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":151653,"name":"Hyper Treasure: The Legend of Macaron","summary":"A Point & Click adventure game with action scenes, movies, QTE and scary monsters / Find the truth among the multiple endings (It looks like this, but it's a precisely made game)","genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Rusimitu"],"publishers":["Rusimitu"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1587081600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co322g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":84006,"name":"Hyperbolic Ignition","summary":"Take control of a deadly spacecraft to destroy hordes of vicious enemies from far-away galaxies in arcade shooter Hyperbolic Ignition.

The other blobs don't want him to do so and will do anything to stop him. The game is somewhat similar to Pac-Man where the Billy has to navigate a single screen labyrinth eating all the beans while avoiding getting hit by the other blobs. To aid him Billy can release bean gas to slow down his adversaries.\n\nDesert Race: This is a simple top down racing game with check points. The player has to make it to the next check point before the time runs out while avoiding traffic. Passing a check point or shooting cars along the way will add extra bonus time.\n\nETMD - Earth Defence: Earth is being invaded by aliens and it's up to the player to stop them! Aliens keep hovering down towards Earth while firing projectiles. The player controls a space ship with which he/she needs to take down the aliens before they reach Earth at the bottom of the screen. When Earth's defenses hit 0%, it's game over! This game supports up to 4 players.\n\nFishy Fishy: This is a side scrolling game in which the player controls a hungry fish. The goal is to keep eating all the smaller fishes to constantly refill the ever draining health meter. This has to be done while avoiding big fishes and other obstacles such as toxic waste barrels.\n\nGreedy Worm: All the worms in the mud pile are hungry for cupcakes! In this Snake variant there are two modes of gameplay. If played single player, the task is to survive as long as possible while eating lots of cupcakes and gaining length, while avoiding the other snakes. If played in multiplayer, the goal is to eat the most cupcakes while trapping the other worms for extra points.\n\nHungry Hungry Toilets: What do toilets eat when they are hungry? Oranges fall down from the sky and by dashing and jumping the players have to have their toilet eat more oranges than the others. It's also possible to jump off of other toilets to gain extra height while at the same time stunning them. The toilet which devoured the most oranges when the timer hits zero wins.\n\nJet Pack Jack: Jack must go into the evil caves of planet Zog and retrieve the stolen cargo. To his aid he has his jet pack and a laser gun. The player controls Jack as he makes his way through the single screen caverns using his jet pack for propulsion and his laser gun to dispose of enemies (which will constantly respawn), while trying to get the cargo boxes to the teleporter. As the levels progress, the amount of cargo which needs to be collected increases.\n\nLame Invaders: Lame Invaders have decided to take over Earth, and it's up to the player to use his/her starship to take out as many of the intergalactic idiots as possible before they can finalize their plans. The game is a side scrolling shoot 'em up where the player has to take down endless waves of enemies in space while gathering bonuses.\n\nPoor Man's Video Poker: This game is a simple video poker machine simulation where each bet is 1 credit. The player gets dealt a hand and can choose to hold cards for a second hand. If the second hand is good enough, credits get paid out to the player.\n\nRevenge of the Blocks: Blocks have been abused by balls and bats for far too long and are out to seek revenge! Stop them before they get a change to exact revenge on you. This game plays like a mix between Breakout and Space Invaders. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen with which a ball needs to be bounced up along the screen to break the blocks lurking at the top. The difference here, however is that the blocks aren't docile blocks. They keep slowly going down while firing at the paddle. Sometimes blocks will dive down on the paddle as well. The paddle on the other hand, has an automatically increasing amount of balls to use against the block uprising.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1304985600,"platforms":["Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gi9qwwub4bxhkfo3zgqe.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":78409,"name":"101 Shark Pets","summary":"Over 100 sharks to adopt, love and play with!","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Teyon","SelectSoft Publishing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1278288000,"platforms":["Nintendo DSi"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8fh7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79794,"name":"=10","summary":"=10 is a mathematics puzzle game featuring Pac-Man","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Namco Bandai Games"],"publishers":["Namco Bandai Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1302652800,"platforms":["Android"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/siqwsqux9ectpyiwl5ch.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"458565","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/%3D10"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"44427","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-44427/"}]},{"igdb_id":79939,"name":"10 Amazingly Awful Games Vol 2","summary":"Oh no!

A young apprentice of Xerxes gets the opportunity to leave the peasant life and take a stab at gold and glory by challenging mythical figures and gods. The gameplay is based on anagrams. Games start with a mix of six letters used to construct words of different length. Letters are selected by moving an arrow-shaped cursor. When a word is formed, points are awarded, a meter fills up, and new letters appear on the tablet.\n\nNext to the story mode, the three game modes can also be played in the Quickplay mode:\nClassical: find as many words of different length as you can before time elapses.\n6-Letter Challenge: find the 6 letter word in a given number of tries.\nEvolution: find words of specific length before time runs out.\nWhile playing, players can earn bonuses that provide additional time or freeze it, guess a word for the player, or shuffle the letters. The player can also receive penalties from his opponent. These empty the bonus gauge, mirror the letters or even hide them. Bonuses become available by discovering the six-letter word multiple times, and penalties arrive when it takes too long to form a word.\n\nThere is a high score screen for each mode and a tutorial explaining the basics. The game offers sound effects and music, along with an overview map in the quest mode, and pre-game screens where the opponents offer some pearls of wisdom.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Gameloft"],"publishers":["Gameloft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1098144000,"platforms":["Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2mgq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":84612,"name":"10-in-1: Arcade Collection","summary":"Let's go back a few years.

The collection contains:\n\nKlingons: You are a spaceship returning from a mining expedition and you have run into a Battlefleet of Klingons but you have no guns so with your shield you must ram them all. The game is viewed from above with you scrolling down the screen and the Klingons scrolling upwards. You receive extra points for any Battleships or Motherships that you hit.\n\nCrash-Landing: Your spaceship has been hit by a meteor and you are prepared for a crash landing on a planet with the only control you have is using your rockets. The game is text only and you see your fuel levels, velocity, height and the time.\n\nSimon: Based on the classic game where the computer shows you a sequence of colours and you have to input the same sequence. Every time you get the sequence correct, the computer adds another colour to the same sequence.\n\nArtist: A drawing program that allows you to draw pictures and shapes on the screen with a cursor.\n\nUFO: A row of UFO's sit on the top of the screen and your spaceship scrolls from the left of the screen below them, firing one shot at a time to remove parts of the UFO's. Every time you hit a UFO you score a point and you start scrolling from the left of the screen again. Missing a UFO or hitting the right side of the screen loses you points.\n\nCode: Based on the game Mastermind, the computer thinks of a 4 digit number and you have to guess it within a set number of guesses. Once you enter a number the computer tells you which number is correct in the right place and which number is correct in the wrong place.\n\nAsteroids: Your spaceship has hit an asteroid field and like the game Klingons you have no gun but instead of ramming the asteroids you must avoid them for as long as possible.\n\nBomber: The game is viewed from the side as you watch a Bomber fly from left to right across the screen. The land is below with a dam on it and you must drop a bomb to hit the dam. Each dam that you see appears in a different location.\n\nKaleidescope: This is program based on the toy where you see dots moving about the screen making symmetrical shapes. There is no interaction from the player.\n\nGuillotine: A two player game based on the pen and paper game Hangman but instead of saving your self from being hanged you must stop yourself from getting your head chopped off by a Guillotine. Player One enters a word and Player two has to type in letters to guess the word. Get a letter right and it appears in the word but get it wrong and a Guillotine starts to appear.","genres":[],"developers":["J.K. Greye Software"],"publishers":["J.K.

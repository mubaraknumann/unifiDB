The game, however, does just the opposite: it puts the player in control of a man who must pursue a fleeing young girl and rape her.\n\nThe game has two gameplay modes. The first is a side-scrolling arcade sequence during which the player has to prevent the girl from reaching her house, and avoid the hazards on the protagonist's way. These include stones, barriers, animals such as dogs and turtles, etc., and can be avoided by destroying or jumping over them. The protagonist runs automatically, but the player can increase or decrease the distance between him and the running girl. In order to make the girl choose the wrong way and fail to find her house, the protagonist throws stones at her (these can also be used to kill animals and destroy obstacles).\n\nAfter the protagonist has caught the girl, the game switches into sex simulation. The player pushes arrow keys in a specific order to correspond with the protagonist's movements. The goal is to sexually satisfy the girl. If the player fails, the protagonist is arrested; if he succeeds, the girl marries the protagonist.","genres":["Simulator","Arcade"],"developers":["Macadamia Soft"],"publishers":["Macadamia Soft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536371200,"platforms":["Sharp X68000","PC-8800 Series","Sharp X1"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6bok.jpg","external_ids":[]}]

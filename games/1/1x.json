The concept is simple: the maps only use 1 texture and 1 flat, with the exception of a single switch texture and F_SKY (which was only allowed to be used if the texture was transferred to it!). The wad features 24 mbf21-compatible maps (01-21, 31-33) made by various authors, with difficulty ranging from around early Sunlust difficulty to absolutely batshit crazy, though difficulty settings are implemented. Maps are ordered very roughly by difficulty. Pistol starts are intended but not required.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1691798400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6yc8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":328156,"name":"1x1","summary":"Become a little soul lost in a dangerous factory, avoid obstacles and battle bosses.

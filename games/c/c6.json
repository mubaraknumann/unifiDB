[{"igdb_id":41017,"name":"C64anabalt","summary":"C64anabalt is an official conversion of Adam Atomic & Danny B.'s award winning single-button 2009 indie game Canabalt for the 8-Bit, 64KB RAM, 1Mhz Commodore 64 home computer developed by Paul Koller (Paulko64). This particular version was designed to run from a 16KB cartridge (although there are also tape and disk versions available to download as well).\n\nThe game was developed as an entry for the RGCD C64 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition (2011), and the name C64anabalt was suggested by Adam Atomic himself. The physics and procedural algorithms are based on those documented in the original game's open source code.\n\nThere are two versions of C64anabalt available; one with a SID chip conversion of Danny B.'s original score by Mikkel Hastrup (Encore), and an alternative build featuring music from the PC indie game ThrustBurst by Andreas Slotte (Ghormak). Unfortunately it wasn't possible to fit them both into a single 16KB ROM, so we've made two versions available to order (more on that in a bit) or download.","genres":[],"developers":["RGCD.DEV"],"publishers":["RGCD.DEV"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1325808000,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"17505","url":"https://rgcddev.itch.io/c64anabalt"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1985984180","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/C64anabalt"}]},{"igdb_id":84129,"name":"C64 & Amiga Classix Remakes Sixpack 2","summary":"Get some of the classic games from the 80s and 90s back on your home PC - as a remake.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1511568000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coadat.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1476170125","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/C64%20%26%20AMIGA%20Classix%20Remakes%20Sixpack%202"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"751680","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/751680"}]},{"igdb_id":93219,"name":"C64 Classix","summary":"C64 Classix is a compilation of a staggering more than 500 Commodore 64 games on one hybrid Windows/Mac CD-ROM.\n\nThe games aren't ports to Windows or Mac platforms, but rather they are stored in the original C64 format and can be played with WinVICE, emulation software included. The games will be loaded automatically after you click on them in a nice GUI, and you don't have to load them one by one in the emulator, which comes in handy. You can even view and read additional information on each game, such as screenshots, the manual, the year of release, the original company that coded the game, links to their web page and more.\n\nNumerous games included have versions where you can choose unlimited lives, level skip etc. Please also note that loading time is emulated as well, but using the warp mode (alt-w) you can speed up the emulator to 1300%, speeding up loading time drastically. Pressing alt-w again makes the game run back at 100% speed again.","genres":[],"developers":["magnussoft Deutschland GmbH"],"publishers":["magnussoft Deutschland GmbH"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1114905600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaunx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"8122","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/C64 Classix"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"8866","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-8866/"}]},{"igdb_id":94773,"name":"C64 & Amiga Classix Remakes Sixpack","summary":"Enjoy the touch of nostalgic retro feel and play 6 classic game Remakes of the C64 and AMIGA era.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1502409600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coadau.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"650864111","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/C64%20%26%20AMIGA%20Classix%20Remakes%20Sixpack"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"679640","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/679640"}]},{"igdb_id":120817,"name":"C64 & Amiga Classix Remakes Sixpack 3","summary":"Get some of the classic games from the 80s and 90s back on your home PC - as a remake.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1564185600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coadav.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1276074412","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/C64%20%26%20AMIGA%20Classix%20Remakes%20Sixpack%203"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1115670","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1115670"}]},{"igdb_id":134400,"name":"C64 Quiz","summary":"The one and only c64 Quiz.

We intended to deliver these words somewhat earlier, back when we covered Football Manager Handheld. Both games are, after all, football management sims based on popular PC forebears and revised for PSP, both were released around the same time, and indeed we started our reviewing in tandem.\n\nIt's just that Championship Manager 2006 has taken a little bit longer.\n\nThere are three reasons for this. The first is that, well, it's rather extensive. Whereas Football Manager Handheld opted for a cut-down, retro approach, Championship Manager 2006 goes the other way. It's every bit as huge as its PC parent, covering 55 leagues from the 12 leading footballing nations.\n\nGranted you can only play with the leagues of one country at a time, but each country has all the appropriate teams in all divisions, as well as reserve teams and youth squads. Each of the resultant 25,000 players has the usual mountain of statistics spread over five screens, detailing their skills, form and happiness, and they can all be trained, transfer-listed, praised or damned in the media, fined, demoted or promoted through the ranks, loaned or sold.\n\nThe transfer market is equally thorough, with a filtering system that enables you to search for specifically skilled players augmented by features like being able to scout or declare an interest in a player to unsettle them, and complex deals involving player-exchanges and sweeteners. With clubs negotiating deals or pulling out and media speculation and disgruntled footballers playing their part, Championship Manager 2006 feels real in a way that Football Manager Handheld didn't quite manage.\n\nThe matches themselves are equally involved affairs. There are six different ways to view the action, ranging from quick result to textual descriptions, possession bars, and a 2D match view complete with crowd sounds.\n\nThe latter is obviously the most tantalising attraction. When you're starting as a manager watching your charges (well, coloured circles) scurry around the pitch is even more hypnotic than viewing a mute pub TV, especially at the slowest speed. Combine this with more tactical options than Mourinho could ask for (custom formations, specific team and individual tactics, and even specific runs and passes for players to make) and you'll see how even pre-season friendlies can absorb hours.\n\nYou might also comprehend why it has taken us weeks of on-and-off play (and multiple recharges) to get through just a season. And though the more casual armchair manager might want to skip through things a little more rapidly (or even take advantage of the shorter Challenge mode), the faithful should be over the moon, Brian.\n\nSadly, the second reason for our delayed review – the interface – isn't as positive. At least ten per cent of our play time must have been frittered away getting to grips with it, and our first few attempts to navigate the hyperlink-strewn pages without a mouse were as frustrating as watching Lampard and Gerrard trying to play the same role in the England midfield. Whilst we did learn how to use shortcuts to ease this torment, the system (like Sven's formation) doesn't feel completely right.\n\nThe final reason for our tardiness? That's the trickiest. We've been reluctant to file our final review because we wanted to be sure how we felt.\n\nIn many ways, Championship Manager 2006 seems to have all the elements of a classic, but it just doesn't entirely convince us.\n\nPrincipally this is down to the match engine, which can feel like it's trying to recreate pinball rather than football. Stray passes, interceptions and the inability to beat players or shoot on target are all part of the real game, but the frequency of these events here in comparison to moments of flowing football are rather soul destroying.\n\nWorse, there's a distinct feeling that the result you get from watching a match is different to that from a quick result, with reported matches offering far more goals than games you play through. Extreme tactical tinkering can help alleviate the situation, but the base level of difficulty seems less forgiving than Alex Ferguson.\n\nAdd to this glitches such as substituted players seeming to reappear, goals being credited to the wrong player and the way certain teams (like Chelsea) seem unbeatable, and what could have been a life-consuming joy becomes an oddly addictive love-hate relationship, as your hopes are raised then dashed and still you come back for more (perhaps it should be called Football Fan Simulator?).\n\nUltimately, Championship Manager 2006 really is a game of two halves, one of which promises glory of Champions League proportions, while the other has a tendency to deliver conference fare. If next season's outing raises its game on the pitch, it really could be deserving of its 'championship' name. Right now, it remains a promising contender.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1162339200,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1102434292","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Champ%20Manager%202006"}]},{"igdb_id":38512,"name":"Chronus Arc","summary":"The Chronus Fragments are needed to prepare for the Time Rewinding, which only takes place once every 10 years.

The start position can be set randomly or determined in a qualifying lap and the length of a race can be set between 1 and 50 laps. Also customizable are color of the car and the gender of the driver, both having only cosmetic effect.\n\nGameplay is Pole Position style, with the own car seen from behind, a perspective view of the track, and cars and roadside obstacles displayed as sprites. A graphical representation of the track, lap times, speed meter and rear view mirrors are always in display. One button accelerates, another brakes. Left and right on the joypad steers while up and down shifts gears if manual transmission (either 4 or 7 gears) has been selected beforehand. Crashing into other cars sends the own car into a spin while hitting roadside obstacles (trees, bushes, rocks or animals) reduces speed to zero.\n\nThe game can be played by up to six players via a ComLynx connection. If fewer players race, remaining slots can be filled by AI-controlled drivers for a maximum of 10 cars per race.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Atari Corporation"],"publishers":["Atari Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Atari Lynx"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3g2o.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1986431177","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Checkered%20Flag"}]},{"igdb_id":158878,"name":"Chess on Ice","summary":"A casual sports simulation game built around using physics to throw and control throwing your rocks towards a target.

The gameplay is identical: a fast-paced, top-down soccer game with emphasis on fast passes and simple control system.\n\nPlayers can choose between 40 national, 64 club or 64 custom (fantasy) teams and can assemble their own tournaments (cup or league) with them. The number of participating teams and some of the rules can be customized. The main difference to the original is the reduced number of pre-set tournaments: for national teams World cup qualifiers and the new Maastricht Cup (a knockout tournament) and for club teams the European Superleague and EUFA Cup. Custom teams only have the Booby League and Turkey Tournament available anymore. Another important difference is that the athletes and tournaments no longer use original names, e.g. EUFA instead of UEFA.\n\nThe SEGA CD version uses its increased storage capacity for additional sound and some rendered movies, e.g. a flight over a stadium before starting a match.\n\nLike the computer version, the only major change compared to the predecessor are the additional eleven national teams and updated team rosters. It also features the World Cup 1994 as pre-set tournament (with the original groups) instead of World Cup qualifiers. Otherwise it keeps the same pre-set tournament options and the option to create own tournaments (cup or league) with the 51 national, 64 club and 64 custom (fantasy) teams.\n\nThe Genesis version features original names which are slightly changed in the European SNES version (e.g. Klonsmann instead of Klinsmann). In the US version, the names have no resemblance to original athletes.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Sensible Software"],"publishers":["Sony Imagesoft","Codemasters"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":752112000,"platforms":["Web browser","Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Sega CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3p6g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":165644,"name":"Chariot Land","summary":"A 3D chariot shooting game The enemy invades, and you fight alone in your chariot.","genres":["Shooter","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1629849600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5cmu.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":165895,"name":"Chess Kingdom","summary":"This is a casual game where players wear helmets and become generals, leading their soldiers to fight with the enemy.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5cnq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":166238,"name":"Child of Light: Limited Edition","summary":"This edition includes the following:\n- Game\n- Poster\n- Artbook\n- Bonus DLC","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Ubisoft Montreal"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1398902400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 4"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5tea.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":166590,"name":"Chou Jiryoku Senshi Microman Generation 2000","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Takara"],"publishers":["Takara"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":945302400,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3rtu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1789760602","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Chou%20Jiryoku%20Senshi%20Microman%20Generation%202000"}]},{"igdb_id":166597,"name":"Chou Hatsumei Boy Kanipan: Hirameki Wonderland","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":938649600,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3rty.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1226534501","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Chou%20Hatsumei%20Boy%20Kanipan:%20Hirameki%20Wonderland"}]},{"igdb_id":166616,"name":"Chicken Defender","summary":"Test your skills in this 2.5D, low-poly tower defense game.

These may be equipped with different types of accessories such as saddles, blankets and decorations. While in the stable, the player can look at each of his horses from nearby and take individual care of them: the quadrupeds can be fed, their fur can be groomed and their hooves can be cleaned.\n\nBy completing tournaments in the three classes and five difficulty settings, the player can win prizes, unlock further content and improve the statistics of his horses. Each horse gains additional experience points through training and participation in tournaments. The game features a number of indoor and outdoor levels of varying difficulty, including a virtual representation of the world championship stadium in the German town of Aachen, home to the World Equestrian Games 2006.\n\nThe controls are somewhat different from most games featuring horses: The reins of the horse are simulated with the mouse and the keyboard is used to control the speed.","genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Radon Labs"],"publishers":["Viva Media","dtp entertainment AG","1C Company"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1116460800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9o1d.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1788201526","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Championship%20Riding%20Star"}]},{"igdb_id":206915,"name":"Charlie Church Mouse: 3D Bible Adventures","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4xct.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"625785742","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Charlie%20Church%20Mouse:%203D%20Bible%20Adventures"}]},{"igdb_id":206916,"name":"Charlie Church Mouse: 3D Bible Adventures 2","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4xcu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1942324383","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Charlie%20Church%20Mouse:%203D%20Bible%20Adventures%202"}]},{"igdb_id":206917,"name":"Charlie Church Mouse: Early Elementary","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"740901314","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Charlie%20Church%20Mouse:%20Early%20Elementary"}]},{"igdb_id":206918,"name":"Charlie Church Mouse: Kindergarten","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"818923833","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Charlie%20Church%20Mouse:%20Kindergarten"}]},{"igdb_id":206919,"name":"Charlie Church Mouse: Preschool","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1416423446","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Charlie%20Church%20Mouse:%20Preschool"}]},{"igdb_id":206920,"name":"Charlie's Angels: Angel X","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1056672000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1696631836","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Charlie%27s%20Angels:%20Angel%20X"}]},{"igdb_id":206921,"name":"Chessmaster","summary":"The Best-Selling Computer Chess Game now available on your favorite console!

It was published in 1985 by English Software. Antic Software published the game in the US. The title is a repurposing of the name of the American Chinese dish chop suey.\n\nChop Suey is a one-on-one martial arts fighting game. The action takes place on a box-type stage, watched by an audience sitting in several rows of seats in front of two competitors. Each successful attack on an opponent means their pain bar goes up and when the bar is full, the POW symbol will start blinking. It means the player is in a very fragile state of health - one more punch or kick and the fighter will fall. The match ends when the fighter falls eight times or the timer runs out. At the top of each wall air vents will open occasionally, allowing scorpions to drop to the floor and scuttle away. The players should avoid them at all costs, as they give potentially lethal bites.\n\nIf the player is victorious, a more difficult opponent is faced in the next match.\n\nSource: Wikipedia","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":[],"publishers":["The English Software Company"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":491702400,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co62nd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"555181573","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Chop%20Suey"}]},{"igdb_id":234413,"name":"Changeling Charade","summary":"Put on a magical disguise to find true love!

You cannot simply send items, traveling takes a lot of energy, you have to eat and drink, and you need to wear appropriate clothing in cold weather to avoid freezing and illness. The primary objective of the game is to survive, as you must eat and drink every day or risk losing health and eventually dying.\n\nOnce you have achieved this critical goal, you can start using your chosen skill, such as farming, breeding, or crafting, to build wealth. Wealth is crucial in the game, as buying shops and learning new skills is expensive. To advance, you will need to grind, but this is what makes the game motivating and keeps you logging in every day.\n\nIn CMA, you can be whoever you want to be - a farmer who wants a peaceful life, a merchant who buys items in one city and sells them in another, or a government official who rises through the ranks to become a governor or a king. It all depends on the skills you choose to learn and how you want to be remembered. Note that the number of skills is capped, so you cannot be a \"Jack of all Trades.\"\n\nWe encourage you to role-play in our forum (coming soon) and reflect your role-play in real actions in the game, but this is not a requirement.\n\nIn this game, Kingdom and community collaboration is a key aspect. The staff organizes periodic events where Kingdoms compete and can earn bonuses for their citizens or for the entire Kingdom. In the future, wars may also be a part of the game.\n\nIf you want to become a King, you will need to be a skilled leader with strong organizational skills. You will need to convince others to help you and make tough decisions to achieve your goals.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Boadicea Web Works"],"publishers":["Boadicea Web Works"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1671667200,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9vwm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"847735358","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Chronicles%20of%20Middle%20Ages"}]},{"igdb_id":342864,"name":"Chemistower","summary":"Learn about Chemistry in this science based Tower Defense game!

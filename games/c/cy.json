The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\".

The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab.

The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.\n\nCombat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\n\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\n\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\n\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga and Sega Genesis.","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["Atari Games"],"publishers":["Atari Games","Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":50.0,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Arcade","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4i0c.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":24402,"name":"Cynosura","summary":"Cynosura is a first-person sci-fi survival sandbox game with RPG elements.

Each Planet is composed of Anti-element Cybertron, it is the only known source in the whole universe and such is its value that many such civilisations have devoted their entire resources to prying off one of the smaller outer planets from the main cluster, in a futile bid to gain access to the untold wealth it would bring, once free from its Anti-elemental Nest.

The game tells the story of our future, after brain-computer interfacing technology has become highly advanced and human civilization has experienced another evolutionary leap, during which, great events have begun to unfold. Justice faces off against evil. The old stands against the new. And forces of conservatism clash with radicalism.\nIn this virtual world, all our heroes and heroines have acquired a “super power” through the help of quantum droids – the ability to turn quantum cube energy into any tactical support device they need. From Optical Camouflage to Quantum Barriers, from a detector that alerts you of approaching enemies, to a medical instrument that heals squad mates; anything and everything can be built, by you, and that's not all. You can choose whatever skills you think will help your strategy the most in any battle.\nWe've even created a vertical combat concept. With parkour features including climbing, gliding, and rolling, players can experience vertical battles on a variety of terrain, including mountains, swamps and deserts. In this game, the arena that hosts your battles are not just a huge, flat map, but a world where you can fly in the sky and move underground. We have also created a number of exploration points scattered throughout the world. Here, you can explore temples in the desert with a chance of finding E-Cores to unlock new skills and weapons.

When entering combat the player uses a gun at long range or a melee attack at short range. Once enemies have been killed the player can take their armor and other items they might carry. Items that can be found include implants and new weapons. After taking damage, medic kits can be used to restore health. The player can hack various computer terminals he comes across. By doing so it's possible to get access to weapon and stat upgrades and to unlock doors. The player might also come across links to the game's website where more of its back story is revealed. Hacking involves playing a mini game that is similar to QIX. The game has some minor RPG elements although the player's stats increase automatically as he progresses through the game. There are also implants that can be used to give the player an advantage through special abilities.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":["Mayhem Studios"],"publishers":["Mayhem Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1199059200,"platforms":["Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9qje.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"73948","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-73948/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"513130","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cyberpunk%3A%20Arasaka's%20Plot"}]},{"igdb_id":120319,"name":"CyberGlide VR","summary":"First real heir of defrag genre in virtual reality","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1561593600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":1,"store":"steam","uid":"1070370","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070370"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1557142925","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/CyberGlide%20VR"}]},{"igdb_id":120532,"name":"Cyberpink","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Superstructure Games"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":120622,"name":"Cytus Alpha: Collector's Edition","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":120678,"name":"Cynoroid: Gentagelse","summary":"The old style 2d-action-shooting-platformer.

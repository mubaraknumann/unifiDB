The inhabitants of Enchantia prayed for the day when the evil hold over them would be vanquished and they could finally live in peace.\nOne of witches had found a spell that would ensure her constant youth. However the main ingredient was a live male child. Male children lived in another dimension, another time, another world. The witch would need a portal and more magic than she possesed. She needed to trick all the other witches in Enchantia into lending her their power so she could make each one young again. She now had enough power to invoke the rejuvenation spell.\n\nOn one particular day our hero, Brad was playing baseball with his sister Jenny. Back in Enchantia the evil witch is looking at the field through the portal. Hungrily and excitedly she incants a summoning spell. Back in the field Jenny pitches a ball towards Brad, he swings the bat in a wide arc and....bang!!!","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":["Core Design"],"publishers":["Core Design"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725760000,"platforms":["DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2y3u.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"17148","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-17148/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"15729","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Curse%20of%20Enchantia"}]},{"igdb_id":12260,"name":"Cutthroats","summary":"Cutthroats is an interactive fiction computer game written by Michael Berlyn and Jerry Wolper and was published by Infocom in 1984.

Also some settlements are ruled at certain times by independent rulers, e.g. Tortuga and Belize. These settlements can be attacked by the player, meaning his crew, with weapons the player chose, will land at the town and can then be controlled to burn and pillage it. Other than this the player controls a ship unit upon a map of the Spanish Main and can plot courses to pins which represent towns; however, if an NPC ship is close enough to the player (these ships spawn at the settlements with goals such as trade between towns or to find pirates), the player will be alerted and go into a smaller bird's-eye map in which they can raise flags to either enter diplomacy with the ship such as asking for information, raise nation flags to avoid them, or obviously raise the Jolly Roger to attack them. Ship combat is worked much as town combat with the player controlling his ship(s) with advanced controls such as where to aim cannon, and what type of shot, right down to scuttling the ship or setting it ablaze.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":938649600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nulhakg2eoiv9lor27wb.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3116","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cutthroats%3A%20Terror%20on%20the%20High%20Seas"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"3393","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-3393/"}]},{"igdb_id":26207,"name":"Cut the Buttons","summary":"In Cut the Button Logic Puzzle you have to move the position of a color button to line it with 2 buttons with similar color.

The game takes place across interconnected screens, often arranged in maze-like patterns, with vertical shafts that required climbing, dropping down, or jumping over chasms. The jump key is also used for attacking, which requires gaining momentum and repeatedly \"bumping\" into the enemy. There are no experience points or any type of currency, but defeating enemies may yield healing potions or better weapons and armor. These items can also be found in the numerous treasure rooms found in the game. The player is given considerable freedom as to which area to explore first, but many areas are initially blocked, requiring the player to procure a key or return with better equipment in order to defeat a stronger enemy guarding the location.

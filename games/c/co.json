Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI’s cooperation.

Players may also bring issues to the coach to solve, which also affects the team's playing ability as well. Gamers will also have access to the coach's clipboard during the game.

Another new feature are the four points of emphasis: ball control, defense, rebounding, and shot selection. Selecting one will boast the team's particular effectiveness in that area proportionate to the coach's attributes. Recruiting, likewise, has been upgraded and tweaked. Gamers can track 15 potential recruits during the season, watching their interest levels and stats and have the option of controlling the recruiting themselves or allowing the assistant coaches to deal many of the decisions.

The three radars are to track either aircraft, ships or submarines and these are represented by a white dot when they are within range. \n \nThe map screen has two maps, one a map of the whole area and the other one showing a closer look at your location. On this screen you can control the speed of your ship and steer it with black dots showing the enemy forces. The status screen shows a profile of your ship and any damage is shown as red and if the whole ship is red then it is damaged and the game is over. \n \nWhen an attack is imminent then a gauge besides one of the mini-game icons turns yellow before turning red and that game can be played. If an aircraft is attacking then the game has you controlling a gun to shoot down the planes viewed from a 1st person perspective. You can move the gun left or right and move it up or down to hit the planes before they drop bombs on your ship. This screen is also used for any missile attack. \n \nIf any convoy's of ships are attacking then you must fire a missile at the convoy by first lining up a sight that keeps moving while a timer counts down. When the time reaches zero and the sight is red then it will hit a ship but if it doesn't turn red then you have missed. \n \nThe final game is when a submarine is attacking and the game switches to a 3D side view showing above and below the water. You control a helicopter above the water while the submarine is below. You can move the helicopter left or right, and in and out of the screen.

While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.\n\nThe main focus in CoE3 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.\n\nIn each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired \"location\" it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.Key Features:\n\n18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have\nCopious amounts of monsters and random events, good and bad\nRandom maps.\nSpell system with 42 magic paths\nNetwork or hotseat multiplayer\nTeam play, you can be 2 players against the AI for example.\nStealth and invisibility. Scouts needed to detect stealthy troops, something better (a star spawn or a beast bat will work) needed to detect the invisible ones.\nAssassins that make an assassination attack before combat starts.\nCatapults, Hill Giants and Rocs that can throw or drop boulders during sieges.\nImmortal Liches and Vampires.\nRegenerating trolls rise from the dead if they haven't been killed too badly or their side lost.\nLarge worms that can swallow smaller enemies whole. Swallowed units take a few points of damage from digestion each round until they are freed.\nShape changers that looks like something else when seen by the enemies.\nAnd many many more monsters and abilites....","genres":["Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["Illwinter Game Design"],"publishers":["Illwinter Game Design"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1346630400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3nih.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"90328","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Conquest of Elysium 3"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"40758","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-40758/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"211900","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/211900"}]},{"igdb_id":15305,"name":"Continent of the Ninth Seal","summary":"The Continent of the Ninth Seal (C9) is an action MORPG.

Instead the setting this time is Syria in the near future.\n\nAs with previous games in the series the focus lies on tactical ground combat battles. Each battle starts with a mission briefing where the player gets to study the strategic and operational maps and gets a description of the mission. After this the player is moved to the 3D battlefield and the Setup Phase where the action is paused. Here the battlefield has setup zones where the player can position his units. The player can here issue commands to his units, which will be activated once the battle begins. When happy with this the player can choose to start the actual battle.\n\nThe game features a number of gameplay styles. In it's most basic form the game is played in simultaneous time, meaning that a second of play time equals a second of real time. Players can however choose to change this to an alternative playing style. In the real-time mode the battles starts after the setup has been completed and only stops if the player chooses to pause the action. In the turn-based mode, each turn of the battle (except for the first) has three phases. It starts with an command phase where the player issues orders. After this comes the action phase where the units execute their orders. This consists of 60 seconds of real-time action. Last is the replay phase where the player can rewind and replay the action. For the first turn of the battle, the action phase is based on the commands given in the setup phase. The player is not able to issue any more commands in the action and replay phases.\n\nEach battle can have a number of different victory conditions based on different objectives. Three main types of objectives exist: terrain-based, unit-based and force-wide objectives. Terrain-based objectives include occupying an area, destroying a building, defend an area or reaching an area. Unit-based objectives can be tied both to single units or to a group of units and include destroying or spotting specific units. Force-wide objectives include the number of casualties, condition of troops and amount of ammo left.\n\nCombat Mission: Shock Force contains two campaign played from the US side: Yakima Training Center and Task Force Thunder. Yakima Training Center is a training mode for new players that teaches the game mechanics. In the Task Force Thunder campaign players take command of a battalion-sized combined arms Task Force across the Syrian border with the goal of splitting the country in two. Combat Mission campaigns are semi-dynamic which means that they consist of both predetermined elements, as well as some that are based on the actions of the player.

Aliens begin peeling off the formation and fly towards the bottom of the screen while dropping bombs. There are two flagship-type aliens (chiefs) at the top of the screen that can fly accompanied with one or more escort (guard) aliens; shooting one or more of the guards before shooting a chief will increase the amount of the chief’s score. If a player does not shoot an alien (or if it doesn’t ram the player’s gun) during its attack run it will return to the formation.\n\nThere are a few differences with Galaxian, as sometimes aliens will return to the formation without dropping below the bottom of the screen (and then reappearing at the top). They also can shoot off a wide horizontal string of bombs, rather than individual shots like on Galaxian. If the last alien on a level (known as \"screens\") is left alone long enough, it will turn into a big winged creature. Also, aliens start changing form: by the third screen, they start resembling winged demons once they leave the formation, plus the player’s gun is bumped up a notch, giving them less time to react to the aliens’ attacks.\n\nPlayers start off with three guns, which can be lost by being hit by an alien or bomb and the game will end if there are no more guns in reserve. An extra gun is awarded at 5,000 points.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Universal Co., Ltd."],"publishers":["Universal Co., Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":318211200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q06h8ac4fjnkwqjk1mvx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1819825245","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cosmic%20Alien"}]},{"igdb_id":40022,"name":"Cop 01","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ghhutuqyivuuyotn1osg.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1532510738","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cop%2001"}]},{"igdb_id":40110,"name":"Combat Hawk","summary":"A reaction-based shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the role of an army soldier.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":565315200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"431233290","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Combat%20Hawk"}]},{"igdb_id":40158,"name":"Coco Loco","summary":"Coco Loco es un Juego original de Petaco inspirado en Pac-man y fabricado en 1981. \n \nEstá basado en procesador 6502, permite jugar hasta 4 jugadores alternándose y pueden aparecer hasta cinco fantasmas enemigos.

The action button on the hand control unit controls the swing of the club. Press down to start the backswing. The longer you press the action button, the higher the backswing. The distance traveled by the ball is determined by the length of the backswing. If you bring the backswing full circle, the club will release automatically, and the distance the ball travels will be random. Release the action button to hit the ball. The backswing of the club will always be clockwise, and the downswing will always be counter-clockwise. The direction taken by the ball will be dependent on the golfer's position in relation to it. It will be perpendicular to the angle of the toe of the club when it makes contact with the ball.\n\nYou can walk your electronic golfer away from the ball and take a practice swing to confirm direction. There is no stroke penalty for this. If you are addressing the ball and starting your backswing, but wish to change the position of your electronic golfer - simply walk him away from the ball and release the action button.

Math permeates every aspect of our lives — work, relaxation, entertainment. Its importance in the future to us and especially to our children will be even greater. Therefore, it is essential for all of us to know and understand how fundamental mathematics operations are performed. In order to develop this understanding, students must have the opportunity to practice, for only through practice can they develop strong mathematical skills. The Computer Math Games VI Solid State Cartridge is one of five modules of math games that can help provide this opportunity. The program was designed by Charles Lund, Supervisor of Mathematics for the St. Paul, Minnesota, public schools and the staff of Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in cooperation with the staff of Texas Instruments Incorporated. The games included in the cartridge are both fun and challenging, with an entertaining, motivating format designed to capture and hold attention. With this cartridge students will be able to: \n- develop math skills by playing four different, enjoyable math games using whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and integers. \n- have fun while practicing mathematics either alone or with other players or team members. \n- develop methods of problem-solving and decision-making. \nThe cartridge is designed to be versatile. It can be used in the home as well as the classroom. The team-use concept allows the cartridge to be used by large numbers of participants, and yet it is equally valuable to your child working alone at home to supplement lectures and homework. The cartridge is intended to be a supplementary aid for children from grades two through nine. It is assumed that the students have been exposed to basic math concepts. While even very young students can use the activities covering addition and subtraction of whole numbers, the cartridge can grow in application as your child grows in ability.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1704394293","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Computer%20Math%20Games%20VI"}]},{"igdb_id":44358,"name":"Computer Math Games II","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1956366991","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Computer%20Math%20Games%20II"}]},{"igdb_id":44470,"name":"Colin McRae Rally 2005 Plus","summary":"Colin McRae Rally 2005 plus is coming to the PSP.

The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers.\n\nElectronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.\n\nThe game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.\n\nForty-three countries have been divided into eleven \"politectonic\" or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.\n\nThese figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.\n\nPp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)\n\nPERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).\n\nFuture shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.\n\nIf you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.\n\nConquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.","genres":["Strategy","Tactical","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp."],"publishers":["North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":378604800,"platforms":["Odyssey","Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8ii4.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"120860759","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Conquest%20of%20the%20World"}]},{"igdb_id":47410,"name":"Company of Heroes: Collector's Edition","summary":"Company of Heroes takes you back to World War II, where you'll guide Able Company through the deadliest battles in WW2's European theatre, including the D-Day landings at Normandy.

Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary School, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago.

Although the Battle of the Bulge is ground that has been visited by wargamers before, it has never been done with this level of fidelity and historical accuracy. The most advanced and realistic model of command decision-making implemented to date in a commercial wargame, combined with thorough historical research on the battlefields and forces involved in this campaign sets Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge apart from the competition. \n \nSet during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge, Command Ops lets gamers assess, plan, order and react at the operational level just like a real Corps, Division and Brigade commander. Hundreds of hours of gameplay await armchair generals who will be challenged to fight their way across 27 scenarios that stretch from the initial German surprise offensive to the powerful Allied counter-attack. \n \nCommand Ops: Battles from the Bulge also sports some of the most advanced and impressive AI ever devised in an operational-level wargame! It is your choice whether to manage every detail of your army, or have the friendly AI manage the war on a lower level while you plan the larger scale maneuvers designed to make short work of your enemy. Just as a historical commander, you can choose where you need to step in and when you need to stand back and let your subordinates do their jobs. \n \nThe enemy AI will use its skill to launch well-timed and coordinated strikes as it probes your lines for weakness while realistically reacting to your movements! In addition, for the enthusiastic mod community awaiting Command Ops, powerful tools like MapMaker and ScenMaker allow for the creation of maps and scenarios further adding to already near limitless replayability.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"developers":["Panther Games"],"publishers":["Matrix Games"],"aggregated_rating":84.0,"release_date":1274832000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g08bkbpwvwljmtmm1x9q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":54658,"name":"Cosmonut","summary":"Squirrelania is starving and they need a hero.

The board is an 8x8 square on which white and black tokens are placed. The starting position has two tokens of each colour diagonally opposite in the central 2x2 square. Black then places a token so that there is now one or more lines (of one or more consecutive white tokens) between the placed token and another black token. These lines can be either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and results in all of those tokens being flipped to black. The same rule applies when white plays to flip black tokens. Players alternate placing single tokens at a time, and must flip a token each turn. Only if no legal move is available can they pass. The aim is to have the most tokens of your colour before both players need to pass.","genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Sony"],"publishers":["Sony"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":441676800,"platforms":["MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8ii0.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"40801","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-40801/"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"44043","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-44043/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"91832","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Computer%20Othello"}]},{"igdb_id":62873,"name":"Community Pom","summary":"Community Pom is a 1997 action RPG/simulation game for the PlayStation, developed and published by Fill in Cafe (best known for the Asuka 120% and Kendo Rage/Makeruna!

This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode.

A fact not that easy to understand when having a try at the series' first entry, as it feels quite unpolished.\n\nThe story about a warrior that seeks revenge on the evil lord that has slaughtered his entire village is a beaten horse, but where the game falls flat the most is its action battle system. There's a severe lack of variety, as the hero only knows no offensive moves other than a standard combo and a dash attack. A block button is supposed to bring more depth to the fighting, but it puts the player in a worse situation more often than not, so a combination of evasion and button mashing is always more effective, the incredibly stupid AI takes care of the rest. Even the bosses seem ridiculously easy at first, that is until they switch into near-invincible mode, which requires hours of grinding to even be able to touch them at this state. There are also only three different weapon types, swords, halberds and (utterly useless) bows. Funny enough, there is a bar that recharges in between attacks and determines the strength of the next stroke, much like in Final Fantasy Adventure on the classic Game Boy.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["HiCom"],"publishers":["HiCom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ygl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146209,"name":"Corum II: Dark Lord","summary":"A far superior sucessor that introduced many improvements, for example a battle system that actually made sense.

To begin with, the story appears much less stereotypical than before. Three mythical sages seek to bring balance to the world by unleashing the power of an ancient magical artefact, the Jumarion. As they can't seize it themselves, they seek out the help of a mortal mage, who longed for the artifact all his life, and leaves a less than thrustworthy impression. Of all this the young knight Kaien knows nothing when he embarks on his pilgrimage. Rather he has to deal with a bunch of supersticious villainers and an alledgedly cursed little girl with a really strange personality...\n\nFor the first time the prerendered graphics are rather good-looking, though they still appear sterile. The combat system has also been improved greatly and now stands nothing short of the greatest of beat 'em up-esque ARPGs like Terranigma or Story of Thor. Magic has never been a strength of the Corum series. Now some of the spells actually come in form of special moves that have to be executed during combos, making their usage much more natural.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Kaien gathers a party of three characters overall. Rather than fighting at the same time at his side, they're available to the player to switch in between them during the game. It goes without saying that each of them comes with their individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\nUnusual for action RPGs, Corum III comes with a network version. The three playable characters would have suited well for cooperative play, but instead the game offers several arena modes, as well as a dungeon rush. It is a nice extra, but amounts to little more than a gimmick in the end.\n\nThe music is by far the best in the series as well. The game was originally released on three CDs, whith the last one entirely dedicated to the CD-audio sountrack. Did the first two games suffer from a rather small selection of songs available, Corum III got the right tune for every mood.\n\nAltogether, Corum III may be the best single player action RPG ever developed in Korea, and it was a loss for Germany that this was passed for a localization in favor of its still rather unpolished predecessor. This time Japan got more lucky, as Bothtec provided a translated version over there. The most funny and at the same time most sad thing is, Corum III actually made it to the US, yet hardly anyone ever got to play it there as the localization was handled by Gobe Software, then publisher of BeOS. Thus the game was only available for that not exactly widespread operating system.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["HiCom"],"publishers":["HiCom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ygn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146211,"name":"Corum Side Story","summary":"The \"Side Story\" in the title already implies that this isn't an ordinary entry in the series, but the extend to which it did away with everything the popular series was known for came as quite a shock for its fans.

Block Kuzushi is basically a home console version of Breakout. Block Kuzushi sold over 400,000 units in Japan, quite the success for Nintendo.\n\nSeveral things made Color TV-Game Block Kuzushi slightly unique when compared to other block-breaking games at the time. The player could choose from several different options, such as the number of balls present during a game and the speed of the ball/balls.\n\nDifferent game modes were present, such as Block Lighter, in which the player must destroy blinking blocks, and Block Through, which would have the ball eliminating every block in its way up to the top (without destroying a block and heading downwards).\n\nIn department stores, managers would hold Block Kuzushi competitions with the winner obtaining a special medal to confirm their expertise in the game.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Nintendo"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":315446400,"platforms":["Plug & Play"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co898b.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2137065497","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Color%20TV-Game%20Block%20Kuzushi"}]},{"igdb_id":220552,"name":"Computer TV Game","summary":"Computer TV Game is a remake of Nintendo's arcade game titled Computer Othello.

European rally racing. It'll turn you inside out and suck every ounce of adrenaline you have. It's totally unforgiving. But you'll love every second of it! It's nothin' but you... the road... and the clock.\n\nEndorsed by the ultimate rally driver himself, Colin McRae Rally remains as faithful to its 3D counterparts as possible. A variety of real-life major rallying cars are available, including Skoda, Ford and the Subaru Impreza. After selecting a car, players can race one of 25 different tracks. Each track has its own unique features and is subject to a variety of weather conditions.\n\nThe main difference in graphics is the change from the first/third person perspective to an overhead 2D viewpoint. With a little experience, the change of perspective is not a big deal. The same racing techniques still apply: take the corners wide, dab the brakes, turn into the corners early and counter-steer to hold the power slide.\n\nThree modes of play that comprise of Time Trial, Rally and Championship have been included, and the gameplay is as unforgiving as the original PlayStation classics. Quite often, bumping just one single corner in a race can knock you back several places. With rally games, the best strategy is often to learn the track at a slow pace and gradually pick up speed, perfecting corners as you progress. Colin McRae Rally for Game Boy Color is no different. The initial frustration with the difficulty is replaced with a satisfied feeling, as you master a course and put in a seemingly untouchable lap record.\n\nGiving even further variety to the game, players are able to take damage in races, forcing them to make repairs in the game’s garage section. The damage adds to the realism and directly influences your driving style. Wall riding around tight hairpins is only faster in the short term, but the time you lose from damage could cost you the race.\n\nIf you like racing games, Colin McRae Rally impresses with its solid gameplay and digitised speech.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":["THQ"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1001289600,"platforms":["Game Boy Color"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co63dt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":235133,"name":"Corbyn Slots: General Election 2017","summary":"Corbyn Slots the Labour UK General Election 2017 themed slot machine from Mobile Amusements!\nHelping promote and drive awareness of the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn in the UK General Election 2017.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"546456490","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Corbyn%20Slots%20-%20General%20Election%202017"}]},{"igdb_id":235185,"name":"Colin McRae Rally 2.0","summary":"Colin McRae Rally 2.0 on the Game Boy Advance adapts the gameplay of the PC/console title to the handheld's capabilities.\n\nThe game features five licensed cars (Ford Focus, Mitsubishi Lancer, Toyota Corolla, Subaru Impreza, Ford Puma) and tracks in six different countries (Finland, France, Sweden, Australia, Kenya, United Kingdom).\n\nThe game's main rally mode takes the player through a championship, with each of the six countries' rally tracks consisting of six stages each. The game takes the simulation approach, with the player being able to adjust suspension, gearbox, steering, tyres and more to fit driving style and road conditions. Damage acquired during a race must be repaired between stages at the expense of time. Besides driving the full championship, it is also possible to practice single rallies and even single stages - a time trial mode for single stages is also available. Tracks not available to be selected from the beginning must be unlocked by winning the championship first.\n\nBesides rally mode, the game also offers arcade mode, which features six tracks for conventional circuit racing. The circuits can be driven as time trials, single races or a championship. This mode also supports multiplayer via the link cable, only requiring a single cartridge.\n\nDuring racing, the track is displayed via a Mode-7-style scaling/rotating bitmap engine, with the cars rendered as texture-mapped polygons. During rally races, the game features a co-driver calling out road features ahead via digitized speech, which is provided by Colin McRae's actual co-driver Nicky Grist.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Ubi Soft Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1031961600,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co86ug.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":235239,"name":"Cool Brick Breaker","summary":"Break thousands of bricks through lots of levels of increasing difficulty with this classic retro style game!","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1406851200,"platforms":["Android"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1713783059","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cool%20Brick%20Breaker"}]},{"igdb_id":235250,"name":"Conquist Tournament","summary":"The successor of the universally acclaimed game Conquist 2, Conquist Tournament delivers an unmatched online experience for board and strategy game lovers.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"742450677","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Conquist%20Tournament"}]},{"igdb_id":235428,"name":"Cosmogonic","summary":"Cosmogonic is a 10 minute interactive science fiction animated short.

All maps use stock Doom II textures (aside from skies and minor extras). The maps are medium-to-large in size and have many different paths that you can take. Replayability was a design goal I tried to aim for. Difficulty is somewhat middling, but should ramp up a bit towards the end.\n\nAlso note that you shouldn't use jumping or crouching in these maps.

(Progressive Game Distributors) in April 1985; it was the last game to run on the altered version of Taito's Qix hardware first used for Space Dungeon, The Electric Yo-Yo, Kram, and Zoo Keeper (two Motorola M6809s run at 1.25 MHz and a Motorola M6802 run at 921.6 KHz, with an added Motorola M68705 run at 1 MHz). The game was originally going to be released by Taito America, but the company never released it because they closed down their manufacturing plant in September 1984. However, the game still credits Taito America and has a 1984 copyright date on the title screen. The player must use two eight-way joysticks (one for moving and one for firing) to take control of a nuclear scientist whose objective is to escape from a flooding reactor as the water's level rises below him before running out of air (which is indicated by the \"AIR LEFT\" meter at the top of the screen) - and every blue-and-magenta square he collects shall add ten shots to his reserve (indicated by the number above the \"AIR LEFT\" meter that starts at 50 for every level), which he must use to shoot creatures that block his progress. Like Mario and Luigi in Mario Bros., the scientist may also disappear off one side of the screen and reappear on the other, but to make him jump, the player needs to push a button on top of the \"firing\" joystick (and good timing is essential for reaching the moving, magenta platforms); furthermore, once the scientist reaches the level's exit, he will receive a bonus of 100 points for every shot remaining in his reserve.","genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co88ck.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":301994,"name":"Cozy Campzone","summary":"“Seek trough the forest around and find all ingredients to make cozy camping coffee recipes!!\"","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1738108800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9cb3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2965730","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2965730"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"107313183","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cozy%20Campzone"}]},{"igdb_id":302016,"name":"Cook Saga","summary":"Be a chief or a waiter, play with or again your friend, learn new skill, buy stuff, upgrade your restaurant.

All it takes is a strategic mind and the will to command. Dive into our game now on Steam and lead your troops to glory!\n\nDive into 6 detailed campaigns each representing a pivotal phase of the Napoleonic Wars — from Preussisch-Eylau in 1807 to the battles of 1814. Each campaign offers a series of battles that shaped the course of history, bringing over 150 missions to your screen.\n\nEach mission showcases a historical battlefield with meticulously positioned army regiments, bringing military history battle maps directly to your screen. Historical accuracy meets tactical gameplay here, where the positioning and terrain play as much a role as your regiments and decisions.\n\nWe've meticulously recreated the authentic design of Napoleonic Wars-era army regiments, complete with historically accurate uniforms and capabilities. It's not just about classifying units as infantry, cavalry, or artillery; it’s about the unique history of each specific regiment, which can significantly impact their role on the battlefield.\n\nTo provide full immersion of battlefield command, we’ve combined turn-based elements like hexagonal grid movement with the simultaneous actions characteristic of RTS. This results in gameplay with a more deliberate pace, where quick reflexes aren’t essential—only a keen strategic mind.\n\nLeverage historical formations like squares, columns, or skirmish lines to gain tactical advantages on the battlefield. Transform your units dynamically to suit the unfolding tactical scenario. With a system designed to minimize randomness, predict the outcome of your strategies and attacks with high accuracy, similar to traditional tabletop wargaming.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Fatice Games"],"publishers":["Revvy Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1727913600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8v52.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3096190","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096190"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"114117189","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Combat%20Directive:%20Napoleonic%20Wars"}]},{"igdb_id":318076,"name":"Countess in Crimson: The Black Dawn","summary":"The Black Dawn DLC adds 3 new romance options into the game","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure","Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Digital Seductions"],"publishers":["Digital Seductions"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1748390400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8v6a.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2718880","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2718880"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1540768","url":"https://digitalseductions.itch.io/countessincrimson"}]},{"igdb_id":318181,"name":"Codebreakers VR","summary":"Codebreakers is a chaotic VR Action Shooter that takes place in a dystopian future where various organizations are fighting for control of the world order.As a breaker, you will have to infiltrate, defeat enemies and avoid security systems to extract data.","genres":["Shooter","Indie"],"developers":["No Sleep Studios"],"publishers":["No Sleep Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1767225600,"platforms":["Meta Quest 2","SteamVR"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9bq3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":318230,"name":"Cosmic Payback","summary":"EARTH, 2562 A.D.\n\nAfter centuries of war and suffering, peace slowly began to return to the world.

[{"igdb_id":218903,"name":"C","summary":"Konami’s LCD port of Contra. Gameplay handles similar to the base stages. The player progresses forward in a pseudo-3D environment as foot soldiers and xenomorph aliens approach and attack.\n\nThere are a total of 3 levels. Each level is completed by destroying central targets on a wall that are guarded by enemies and missiles; the targets are collectively termed Falcon Phaso-Sensors. The player automatically runs through each corridor, which progressively increases in distance, during which soldiers and aliens are confronted; at the end of each are the boss battles, the sensors.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8iaj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":385380,"name":"C","summary":"A game where number goes up","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1769385600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coba4h.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"414699133","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/C"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"4276530","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4276530"}]}]

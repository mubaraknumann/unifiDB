From Japanese indie developer YOTSUBANE, AdventurePlanningService, this unique top-down shooter is a wild ride you won't want to miss out on.\n\nYour first step in Crimzon Clover: World Ignition is as simple as choosing how you want to play, and which powerful ship will be yours to command. Choose your mode from Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.\n\nBoost Mode will adjust the difficulty based on how proficient you are at devastating your enemies. Original is a basic mode designed for casual players. Unlimited turns each stage into an intense battlefield of bullets that only the most hardcore players will be able to survive. Time Attack pits you against the clock as you race to finish each stage with the best time. There are also different ways to play those modes, including Original, which is exactly the same as the arcade mode, for all the fans that already know the game. There is also a Novice setting with both Original Mode and Boost Mode available for beginners and casual players.\n\nEach of the three ships has their own style of standard firing and a unique appearance. The firing style is translated beautifully as you amp your way into Break Mode and Double Break Mode! As you blast through your foes in each stage you can collect stars that will raise your Break Meter, which allows you to wipe the screen with powerful bombs or, if you have the patience, blast off into Break Mode to add a huge boost to your firepower and let you rip through enemies with ease. That's not the extent of your strength though, as having a full Break Meter while in Break Mode will allow you to enter the ultimately destructive Double Break Mode. Watch your enemies crumble in fear as you turn the tide and fill the screen with your own hellacious rain of firepower! The best course of action is sometimes the hardest to wait for, as that Double Break Mode could be just the boost you need to help you tackle the insane bosses you'll face at the end of each stage! They may seem insurmountable, but their power is finite. Can you bring them to their knees?\n\nHaving a tough time on a specific stage? No worries. Hit up the Training screen to set up your own scenario using your choice of mode, ship, stage, and freely customize other variables to practice the fight for survival. Training doesn't seem like a bad idea after you see what the enemies are capable of. Can you pilot your craft through the bullet massacre the enemies have prepared for you?

To do so, the player must race against a group of computer controlled opponents in a variety of illegal races across the country. The races are divided into three leagues, each one with increasingly harder opponents, and the player needs to regularly upgrade his Lamborghini Diablo in order to keep him above the rest of drivers, by using the money from bets as well as the bonuses obtained when finishing races in the first place.\nThe races themselves take place in a variety of scenarios (mountain roads, the desert, urban settings) and they include weather conditions such as rain and snow. At the end of each league, and in order to be able to join the next one, the player has to go through a \"challenge\", consisting of a timed race in a highway infested with trucks.\n\nDespite the game obtaining mostly positive reviews, a major source of complaints came from the saving system. Players are allowed to save their progress once every four races.

Its gameplay was similar to SNK's earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat 'em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.\n\nThe game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen.[1] As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!,[2] the game's perspective may be considered either first-person or third-person.[citation needed] The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator. A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords 2 was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port.\n\nCrossed Swords requires correct timing and movement to progress. The basic rule for the game is to defend first before striking. The player wields both a weapon and shield and can strafe, as well as guard the upper or middle part of the body. Two different weapon strikes are available, a regular attack and a thrusting attack. Weapon-based magic can also be used. Multiple paths through the game are available and the player has an option to skip the first and second chapters freely.\n\nIn the enchanted land of Belkana all was well until plagues of creatures started rampaging through. But it didn't stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called \"The Knight of the Journey\" came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities. After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight's progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":799372800,"platforms":["Neo Geo CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co65ap.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":47766,"name":"CrossworDS","summary":"Crosswords DS supports up to four different players, and features two basic modes - Training and Main Game.

After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.","genres":["Fighting","Racing","Sport"],"developers":["Arc System Works","Technos Japan"],"publishers":["Aksys Games","Arc System Works","American Technos"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":717897600,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS","Wii","Wii U","Nintendo Entertainment System","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3vva.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":11,"store":"android","uid":"9MWQL2PXV7L8","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/-1-/9MWQL2PXV7L8"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"8109","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-8109/"}]},{"igdb_id":48292,"name":"Crackout","summary":"Crackout is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Konami in 1991.

There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11).

The buildings themselves are laid out differently In the first stages, for example, the buildings start out as square skyscrapers. Later levels, however, require you to scale round ones. As well as this, new threats are introduced, such as:\n\n- Circling vultures that throw eggs at you.\n- Gorillas reaching out to grab you on both sides of the building.\n- Window cleaners that go from left to right, making you fall if you get in their way\n- Boulders thrown from elevators\n\nCC2000 also allows you to move from one face of the building to another.

Yuu appears in the game, but is not the protagonist; the player controls four young women in four different scenarios: two of them, Yuri and Aya, on the Earth, and the other two, Ora and Sita, in an alien world, mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy. The story goes beyond the original anime by introducing a magical, sacred land known as Finality, populated by fantasy being, and calling the guardians (the four girl protagonist) to bring peace to the galaxy.\n\nFutatsu no Sekai plays automatically for the most part, except key scenes which allow interaction - two, sometimes more choices that have to be done by the player. In many cases these choices are merely cosmetic, or may lead to a different text description and scene.","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Wishbone"],"publishers":["Wishbone"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":775180800,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4a48.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":184511,"name":"Crusader Kings III: Royal Court","summary":"The Royal Court expansion to Crusader Kings III adds new ways to interact with the characters in your kingdom or empire, as well as major changes to the cultural system of the game, adding greater dynamism and historical fluidity.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1644278400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5d93.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":184890,"name":"Craftomation 101","summary":"You land on a frozen planet in a tiny rocket with a robot inside.

Each tank can fire a bullet at a time, and move to avoid the opponent's fire. Contact with a bullet will destroy your tank, earning your opponent a point, and the first player to five points wins the contest.\n\nThe current game has a couple of important differences from the original. The most important is that bullets do not just travel in a straight line after you fire them. They move in the direction in which you last directed your tank. This allows you to fire around corners, and even to shoot yourself (gifting your opponent a free point). Secondly, there are a number of different arenas which can be chosen, with different wall layouts. Some of these layouts also include a turn-style which allows you to pass but stops any pursuing bullets.

The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike Dragon Quest, there are no random encounters on the world map.

Players assist elemental dinosaur-like creatures known as Dynomites to rebuild a shattered Earth and ultimately escape it. The core loop is simple (Collect -> Craft -> Trade -> Build), but by connecting to the player-owned economy, it adds unlimited depth to the gameplay. Designed for both web2 and web3 gamers, Craft World combines engaging gameplay, a player owned economy, and active community collaboration.\n\nWe believe a player-owned economy takes years to build, and requires constant iteration. That’s why we launched Craft World on testnet in 2023, and have been updating and improving it weekly ever since, in public, with the help of our community. Their feedback and ideas have shaped everything from in-game mechanics to economic design.\n\nUnlike many Web3 titles that retrofitted blockchain tech into existing games, Craft World was built from the ground up with blockchain in mind and was designed to fully unlock what ownership and interoperability can actually look like in practice.\n\nCollect, craft, trade, and build - In Craft World, your actions drive a player-owned economy and shape a thriving community. Designed for both Web2 and Web3 gamers.\n\nDynomite NFTs produce tokens every day\nConstantly working in their fields of expertise, the Dynos produce $fire or $water tokens. These elements can be either used as currencies to buy and upgrade factories in the game or they can be transferred to your wallet.\n\nUse Factories and craft New Materials\nThe Dynos combine, improve, and imbue these elements to invent new things. Factories can be used to transform elements to new materials, which are needed to build up Masterpieces.\n\nMasterpieces benefit you and the community\nMasterpieces require many elements and material tokens, and therefore you have to contribute your tokens together with the community.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["VOYA Games"],"publishers":["VOYA Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1753747200,"platforms":["Web browser","Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa4wd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1577294577","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Craft%20World"}]},{"igdb_id":355549,"name":"Cradle of Egypt: Collector's Edition","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"939653226","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cradle%20of%20Egypt:%20Collector%27s%20Edition"}]},{"igdb_id":355609,"name":"Creepy Dungeons","summary":"Help this brave knight navigate the halls of Creepy Castle to save Princess Sinclive from the secret dungeons.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Automata UK"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["ZX Spectrum"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa60n.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"655942814","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creepy%20Dungeons"}]},{"igdb_id":355892,"name":"Crayola Scribble Scrubbie Pets","summary":"Color, care and play with adorable pets!

Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins.

Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles.\n\nThere are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are \"attending\" a Cabela's-themed camp. Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or obstacles are \"blamed\" on the character.\n\nEvents in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more \"unusual\" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the classic electronic game Simon.

Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 ups the ante with the most realistic animals ever seen in the Cabela's series. Every animal's unique movement gives clues on what the animal will do next. In order to bag the trophies, players will have to avoid detection through cunning, skill, and deception. They must also utilize master hunting skills such as advanced stalking techniques so they can quickly move through cover and close in on their targets.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Cauldron HQ"],"publishers":["Activision Value","Activision"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1317081600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co60b7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":6650,"name":"Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 (With Top Shot Elite)","summary":null,"genres":["Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Cauldron HQ"],"publishers":["Activision Value"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1317081600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co60b6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":6651,"name":"Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai","summary":"Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai is a departure from typical Cabela's gaming fare in that its focus is not on hunting. Rather, Survival is designed more as an action-adventure game with Cabela's-themed hunting elements.\n\nThe story revolves around Logan James, a private pilot flying a doctor (Doctor West) though Alaska to deliver highly important cargo to an important destination--where people's lives are at stake! Unfortunately, sans flight plan and going into a storm, the plane crash lands near Katmai Mountain and forces the pilot to venture into an adventure to survive and escape the mountain alive and with their important cargo intact. Wild animals such as bears, wolves, cougars and even birds threaten survival, and require the pilot to dredge up any hunting and survival skills he has.\n\nThe game is designed to be compatible with the Top Shot Elite gun peripheral, and as such, there is a targeting cursor onscreen that the player uses to hunt or even use some equipment, with all the aiming done manually with the Top Shot Elite. With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar to a Third-Person Shooter. The player has the ability to perform \"Focus Shots\" which slow down time and allow for visible placement of internal organs of the animal being hunted or defended against.","genres":["Sport","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["FUN Labs"],"publishers":["Activision Value"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1320105600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5x5m.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":6652,"name":"Cadash","summary":"Cadash is an early example of what would become a fairly common trend in Japanese-made arcade games of the early 1990s: the \"platform-RPG\". Cadash borrows many principles of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link's gameplay, combining side-scrolling platform action with an RPG system of statistics, levels, money and magic.\n\nFour characters can play at once in the arcade version, and up to two players may select from four different characters in the console versions: fighter, mage, priestess, and ninja, each with different attacks, statistics and skills. Players then proceed through each level, killing monsters and bosses, collecting keys to unlock doors and collecting gold and experience. Gold is also taken from slain foes and treasure chests. Villages sell items, weapons, armor and (in the console versions) extra lives, with each village encountered providing better equipment. Some villagers and benevolent creatures will also provide information. The arcade version has a limited game time, which can be extended by buying progressively more expensive hourglasses at shops, or by picking up rare bonuses. In shops, and in hidden places, are medicinal herbs which restore 10 HP if brought to zero, and antidotes which cure poison inflicted by specific foes. There are also two elixirs in the game that act like medicinal herbs, except that they restore all HP.\n\nThere are five stages in the game. Stages one, two and four consist of two worlds, above and below ground. Stage three consists of three worlds. Stage five is set entirely within Castle Cadash. The environments differ significantly, from pleasant meadows to caves, and from forests to underwater environments. Some foes encountered in these levels are derived from common mythology while others are completely made up for the game.","genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Arcade","Wii","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5kjq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":6654,"name":"Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle","summary":"Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle is a pirate themed adventure game about a girl who goes on a quest to find the legendary \"Golden Turtle\".

At the start of a new game, the player must register a new hunter or continue with a saved hunter. The point of the game is hunting dinosaurs to get trophies and accumulate score. Each dinosaur represents a set number of points. A novice hunter starts with zero points, when his points increase he'll be able to hunt new dinosaurs on additional terrains with more powerful weapons. If the player is killed by a dinosaur, all points accumulated on that specific hunt are forfeited. The player must be picked up by DinoHunt to keep the points he earned.\n\nA hunter will become Advanced after earning 100 points, and Expert with 300. To begin a hunt, the player must choose the location, the weapon, the dinosaur and some hunting accessories which help the player but will deduct the score during that hunt. Each location is unique, with varying difficulties and terrain. The new hunter will be given three areas, with two more added for the Advanced hunter and a final area for the Expert hunter, for a total of six locations. Level locations include jungles, and deserts accompanied by pyramids and an ancient temple.\n\nNext, the player must choose a dinosaur to hunt. A new hunter will be given the choice of four dinosaurs: Parasaurolophus, Stegosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus and Allosaurus. An Advanced hunter gains the ability to hunt the Triceratops and the Velociraptor. Only an Expert hunter can hunt the Tyrannosaurus rex. Harmless creatures such as Moschops, Gallimimus and Dimorphodon are present in each level. They are worth zero points and can be killed with a single shot.\n\nThe player must also choose a weapon, which can be set for kill or tranquilize for additional points. A beginning hunter can only use a shotgun or a crossbow. A sniper rifle is unlocked upon becoming an Advanced hunter. First time hunters can use the Observation Mode to familiarize themselves with dinosaur behavior and different terrain.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Action Forms Ltd."],"publishers":["WizardWorks Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":912384000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zh0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11783,"name":"Cave Story 3D","summary":"Having received tremendous acclaim in its previous releases on PC and WiiWare, Cave Story, an indie side scrolling 2D action game, now makes its way into an all new dimension with Cave Story 3D for Nintendo 3DS.

Areas of the game world set on the surface feature the witch flying on a broom stick, while underground segments require the witch to run and jump in caverns. In the flying segments, players must search for four randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients. The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking. While traversing the game world, the witch encounters Halloween-themed enemies such as pumpkins, ghosts, skulls, and bats, as well as other creatures like sharks and seagulls. A collision with an enemy causes the witch's magic meter (which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies) to decrease. The character dies once the meter is depleted. After dying, the character reappears on the screen and the meter is refilled.

The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the \"Witch Queen\". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin. \n \nFollowing the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book. \n \nCauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["The RamJam Corporation"],"publishers":["Palace Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536371200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jyk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":13470,"name":"CaveMania","summary":"Fed up with having Brontosaurus steaks for dinner, Ug the Caveman has decided to try something new for a change - by navigating nine islands in search of the three pterodactyl eggs perched high in the mountains, and bringing them back to his cave one by one, making sure that not one egg breaks along the way.

Castle Blast is Ronen Habot's first foray into programming the Atari 5200. Ronen used this experience as a means to write a tutorial on Atari 5200 programming to assist others who might want to write games for the system. \n \nCastle Blast made its debut at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where it was sold with a box, manual and cart. AtariAge held a Castle Blast Label Contest in April, 2002. Castle Blast may be ordered directly from the author, Ronen Habot, by visiting the Castle Blast Development Page. \n \nThe object of this game is to destroy the Castle on the Mothership. You fire Vertical Trajectory Missiles, or VTMs, at the shield on the bottom of the Mothership. When you penetrate the shield, then blast the Castle. To score extra points, you can also shoot the enemy spaceships flying overhead. \n \nIf you destroy the Castle, you advance to the next level, where you will need to contend with Focused Energy Beams, or FEBs, fired from the Mothership. There will also be stars appearing in the sky, making it harder to target the spaceships. \n \nIf you manage to obliterate the Castle again, you will proceed to the next level, which adds ground-based tanks assaulting you. You have Horizontal Trajectory Missiles, or HTMs, to deal with this new enemy but do not lose sight of your primary goal. \n \nYour joystick moves you left or right.

There are graphics but nothing more than basic icon-on-map bare essentials. That may sound like a bad thing but in reality it's not since Carrier Strike more than makes up for that shortcoming by offering intense and detailed game play. The game is based on a fairly simple premise: have your carriers kick the stuffing out of their carriers. But the rub here is that in order to do that, you've got to find their carriers first. In a decidedly cat-and-mouse fashion, each day that dawns on the high seas of the South Pacific will find you desperately searching through bad weather, rough conditions or simply the enormous body of water to just locate the enemy before any sort of military action can take place. If you're an expert who knows the historically correct Japanese hiding spots, the designer has seen you coming and offers a random enemy placement option to keep you guessing.\n\nWhat makes Carrier Strike a challenging game, though, is the balancing act you'll be required to perform as the area commander over all the actions a carrier is capable of during war. Eventually, once you've found your targets, you'll quickly find yourself hip deep in the dizzying tasks of assigning combat air patrols for defense of your task force, managing weapons load-outs and fueling of various types of aircraft, giving orders for searches or air attacks, monitoring other ships and generally just holding the whole ball of wax together. All of this is accomplished through a turn-based system where each turn equals twenty minutes of real time. This becomes a factor in some operations and can lead to confusion or wasted blocks of time if your coordination skills are lacking. The hardware in Carrier Strike mirrors the actual weaponry, ships and planes that were used in the South Pacific during WWII. Outside influences such as the introduction of better radar and the slow decline of the enemy's pilot efficiency are realistically phased in during the game. Fortunately, the interface is fairly simple and easy to use since you'll need all your time coordinating events.\n\nUltimately, Carrier Strike will appeal to those war gamers who bask in statistics and a realistically based war machine. Those looking for flashy graphics and killer cut scenes won't find them here. Be prepared for a logistical and strategic exercise when in command of your Carrier Strike. Fast thinking and calm nerves will be a plus when faced with operating elevators bringing aircraft up to the deck while under heavy enemy fire and at the same time coordinating their missile and bomb loads, take off and mission orders. Selecting the appropriate aircraft and weapons based on what your search planes find requires precise scheduling and prompt decision making. Carrier Strike offers an accurate, enjoyable simulation of carrier warfare in the South Pacific.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)"],"publishers":["SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725760000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7kla.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2750","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Carrier%20Strike"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"3002","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-3002/"}]},{"igdb_id":47139,"name":"Cash Crop","summary":"The Delightfully Fun Cannabis Farming Game!

The single-player campaign has you battling Russian ultranationalists, led by Vladimir Markov, as members of the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS. You'll battle across war-torn areas of New York City, London, Paris, Mogadishu, Dubai, and other regions as you prepare to end the global threat once and for all.\n\nAs with previous entries in the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 3's campaign features a heavily scripted, cinematic experience with Hollywood-style special effects. One new mission, for example, has you involved in underwater travel with a sonar-equipped submersible watercraft. You'll then fight inside an enemy-controlled submarine before guiding an inflatable raft across turbulent waters while a naval battle rages nearby. Other sequences have you firing mounted guns, driving vehicles, and more while explosions light up the landscape.\n\nReturning to the game is the cooperative Spec Ops mode that features a series of standalone missions on different maps. New to Spec Ops is a survival option that has you and either a friend or a computer partner battling waves of enemy forces. Shooting down enemies earns you cash, which can be used to purchase new perks, items, weapons, and other upgrades. You'll also be able to earn bonuses by working together as a team and maintaining kill streaks.\n\nThe heart of the game is once again the 18-player online component, which introduces all-new maps and a variety of enhancements to the format introduced in Modern Warfare 2.

The player can move around on foot or in cars that can be stolen. The game is controlled from a third-person perspective with an optional inside view while driving a car. Movement is done through the keyboard while the mouse is used to steer, zoom and rotate the camera.\n\nBy performing missions or beating up people the player earns cash. This can be used to repair a car or get gas as all cars only have a limited supply. This is shown in the bottom right corner of the screen while the bottom left corner shows a mini-map of the city to view gas stations, targets or police cars when a tracker has been installed. In the different missions the player will need to steal cars, install trackers on police cars, race another character, kill an entire opposing gang or escort the boss. While moving around on foot, the protagonist can beat up other character or use any of the three available weapons: a pistol, a uzi gun or a wrench.

He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!\n\nCompared to the first game, Can Can Bunny Superior plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like \"Look\", \"Move\", etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Cocktail Soft"],"publishers":["Kirara"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":640224000,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","Sharp X68000","PC-8800 Series","DOS","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co779a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":108894,"name":"Can Can Bunny Spirits","summary":"The third in the Can Can Bunny series, Can Can Bunny Spirits deals with a nameless hero (the player has to give him a name) who is - in accordance with Can Can Bunny tradition - a lonely guy who can't get a girlfriend. One night he sits at home and stares at the moon. Suddenly, the magic fairy Ariko appears in front of him and gives him... no, this time not the Magic Book, but a Magic Crescent! With the help of this crescent, the hero can turn into totally different young men - which will naturally increase his chances in impressing girls and ultimately having sex with them.\n\nCan Can Bunny Spirits is much less of an adventure and more of a strategy game than its predecessors. Success depends even more on the preparations before the actual decisive stage. There is also extensive customization in this game. In the beginning, the hero chooses what he wants to be like, which includes age, height, blood type, and other parameters. Then Ariko introduces several girls to him, of which he has to choose one. Afterwards, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving the right answers, combining knowledge of the girl's preferences and of the character's statistics. Each girl has a \"love meter that can be raised or lowered depending on the player's strategies, and once it is full, the hero can have his way with the girl.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":681782400,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","PC-8800 Series","FM Towns","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4kw4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":108895,"name":"Can Can Bunny Premiere","summary":"In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant.

But before you decide to throw the uninvited guests out of your apartment, a beautiful green-haired woman appears. This is the goddess Swatty, and she has power over the Seven Lucky Gods, which the mysterious seven creatures turn out to be. Swatty feels pity for the lonely hero, and decides to help him to find a girlfriend.\n\nCan Can Bunny Premier is the fourth installment in the Can Can Bunny series. Compared to its predecessors, it is the most pure Japanese-style adventure, without the strategy parts of the previous game. The player chooses menu commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc., as well as context-sensitive commands and dialogue choices) in order to advance the game. At several points it is possible to branch the story line, which mostly influences the amount of success the hero has had with a girl.","genres":["Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":["Cocktail Soft"],"publishers":["Ides"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":712454400,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","Sharp X68000","PC (Microsoft Windows)","FM Towns","Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8eur.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":109012,"name":"Cake Bites Make & Bake: Cooking Dessert Kids Game","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"337550131","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cake%20Bites%20Make%20&%20Bake:%20Cooking%20Dessert%20Kids%20Game"},{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"636899705","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cake-bites-make-bake-cooking-dessert-kids-game/id636899705?mt=8&uo=4"}]},{"igdb_id":109015,"name":"Cake Shop","summary":"Cake Shop is a cafe game.

There's four years (1942-1945), each one with two soldiers to choose from, each with their own set of missions. Everything but the first missions are locked, and you have to complete them to unlock the later ones, eventually unlocking the next year as soon as you finish every mission in the earlier one.\n\nThe missions can vary wildly, from location to objective and weapons. In some missions you have a team of soldiers to help you out, in others you have to work solo. You'll be instructed along the mission on what to do, as well as receiving hints and tips on how to do it. You may have to take down enemy troops, call in airstrikes, hide from bomber attacks, destroy enemy vehicles or even be left all alone sniping enemy units. The time you take to beat the mission is stored so you can try to beat the default \"best time\" or your own best time.\n\nThe game works in a pseudo top-down view, since the game works like a 2D top-down but the scenario is rather 3D. Most of the maps are similar, having you start on the bottom and having to make your way up to the top to progress through the mission. You can crawl under sandbags or hide behind buildings for cover, and sometimes there's medics spread around to assist you. The weapons are varied, from pistols, machine guns, sniper, bazooka or even a walkie-talkie to call in airstrikes. Most of the weapons simply fire forward, but to help you aim, some can \"auto-point\" at nearby targets, and others have a reticule that you move around with the D-Pad.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Mforma Europe Ltd."],"publishers":["MFORMA Group Inc.","Activision Publishing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1136505600,"platforms":["Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9wrj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":119177,"name":"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare","summary":"Prepare to go dark, Modern Warfare is back!\n\nThe stakes have never been higher as players take on the role of lethal Tier One operators in a heart-racing saga that will affect the global balance of power.

Balthazar Carter arrives only to find that his professor had gone insane and the expedition is put on hold. The new director is known to be interested in the occult and doesn't take kindly to Balthazar's curiosity. Being an expert in old Religions, players will need to help Balthazar uncover what happened to the professor, what was the find as well as the mysteries of an ancient religion which worships the god Cthulhu.\n\nThe game plays out as a point-and-click adventure, but instead of a mouse interface, players control the protagonist directly with him walking to the direction key players have pressed. Players are hinted when they're close to usable objects or people and can trigger a menu where they can choose what they want to do with the objects. Players can pick up and use items and during their adventures they will see a lot of cutscenes of what's going on in the city. Players switch to a top-down view when traveling through the city.

The citizens of the Earth celebrated for the first time in almost six years. The forces of Hell had been beaten. Humanity had won. Now began the long process of burrying the dead and rebuilding, but the nations of Earth were united now, and they were willing to work together to usher in a golden age of peace.\n\nHowever, all was not as well as it had seemed, for six months later, more Hellspawn began to appear and the air was once again heavy with cries of pain and screams of death. The war was not over yet, after all. You were stationed at the top secret military base when the source of the latest demonic invasion was pinpointed. Once again, the Marine Coprs was called upon to do battle with the damned. Your recon platoon was the first to go in.\n\nThe target location was a mining facility owned by the UAC. At least, officially, it was a mining facility, but upon investigation, it became clear that more had been going on here than mining. The place was abandoned, yet the machinery was in full operation. There simply were no people there. There seemed to be no Hellspawn, either. Once the area was secured, attention was turned to the mines.

They literally came out of nowhere, biting and snarling, and no matter how many you and the others blasted, more seemed to fill the gaps.\n\nWhen ammo was running low, you and the other marines took cover. Somehow, you got separated from the others, and when all was quiet, you came out to see what had happened. Of the Hellspawn and your buddies, there was no sign, except for a trail of blood leading into the mines. With the sun setting red at your back, you stood looking at the mine entrace which under the fiery glare looked like the gaping maw of some Hellish beast waiting to devour you alive.\n\nScrewing your courage to the sticking place, you draw your pistol, the only weapon you have left, and enter the Mine...","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1019606400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6rft.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":256835,"name":"Cat Burglar","summary":"In this edgy, over-the-top, interactive trivia toon, answer correctly to help Rowdy the Cat evade Peanut the Security Pup to steal some prized paintings.","genres":["Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Netflix"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1645488000,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6swt.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1017884766","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cat%20Burglar"}]},{"igdb_id":256837,"name":"Captain Underpants: Epic Choice-o-rama","summary":"In this interactive special, Harold and George need your decision-making skills to stop Krupp from blowing their beloved treehouse to smithereens.","genres":["Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Netflix"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1581379200,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6sxg.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"110491890","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Captain%20Underpants:%20Epic%20Choice-o-rama"}]},{"igdb_id":256843,"name":"Carmen Sandiego: To Steal or Not to Steal","summary":"You drive the action in this interactive adventure, helping Carmen save Ivy and Zack when V.I.L.E. captures them during a heist in Shanghai.","genres":["Quiz/Trivia","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Netflix"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1583798400,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6sxi.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"790994091","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Carmen%20Sandiego:%20To%20Steal%20or%20Not%20to%20Steal"}]},{"igdb_id":257103,"name":"Caxy Gambá Encontra o Monstruário","summary":"Caxy Gambá Encontra o Monstruário is a point-and-click adventure game that tells the story of Caxy Gambá, a marsupial who, during a stormy night, takes shelter in a mansion in the middle of nowhere.

Although this may sound rather easy, one has to keep in mind that the game was geared toward young children, so things had to be kept simplistic. Care Bears made it to the beta testing stage before the marketing department decided to stop work on the game citing that the market for childrens games was diminishing, and the gameplay was too dull. Therefore it was decided that all further development on the game was to be stopped. According to programmer Laura Nikolich, part of the reason Care Bears was killed off, was that the marketing department really didn't know what they wanted. The Care Bears product line was aimed at the 8 and under age group, but marketing wanted a more action oriented game designed for older kids. Although Nikolich described the game as being almost finished, the only known prototype to surface is nothing more than a graphics demo.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Parker Brothers"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mfl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":282684,"name":"Capcom Tabi Quiz 100","summary":"Capcom Travel Quiz 100 is a mobile browser-based quiz game made as a part of the JR Tokai x Capcom collaboration event.

It was later made available to download for free to everyone as well as being included in an update for Call of Duty: Black Ops II on Wii U.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Treyarch"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1352764800,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co80ue.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":295259,"name":"Catarsis: Catventure","summary":"Step into an exciting journey in Catarsis, a rogue-like action game where you are the last hope for the world.

At the end of a game, you earn gold to buy card packs and thus improve your cards for the next game, and acquire new cards.","genres":["Strategy","Indie","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["White Cat Games"],"publishers":["White Cat Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co94h2.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3256450","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3256450"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"575204213","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cards%20of%20Prophecy"}]},{"igdb_id":307494,"name":"Cars Race-O-Rama","summary":null,"genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Tantalus Interactive","Incinerator Studios"],"publishers":["THQ"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1255305600,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8fum.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":307506,"name":"Castlevania II: Subotai's Hunt","summary":null,"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Subotai"],"publishers":["Subotai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1382918400,"platforms":["Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8js8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":307637,"name":"Cazzarion: Bomber Attack","summary":null,"genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Armin Unold"],"publishers":["Armin Unold"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1719792000,"platforms":["PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8g63.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"7636095","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Cazzarion:%20Bomber%20Attack"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10011573","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011573"}]},{"igdb_id":307692,"name":"Cakey's Twisted Bakery","summary":"It's bake or die at Cakey's Bakery, where human children are the secret ingredient to strange monsters' delicious pastries.

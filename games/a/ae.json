It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity. Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer a variety of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class.\n\nIn Aerobics Revolution, similar to Dance Dance Revolution, you play Aerobics instead of dancing, using the Dance Dance Revolution dancing mat controller. You can also keep track of the amount calories you spent and your diet supplement with this game, as well as setting up your own exercise schedule.\n\nAerobics Revolution is the natural progression from video game dancing, which is an aerobic exercise in its own right, would be video game aerobics in your living room. In the 80s, Jane Fonda showed women the ways through VHS and Konami seeks to do the same by way of PS2.

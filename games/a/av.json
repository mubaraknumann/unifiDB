It’s a platformer that has your character jumping, punching and cursing every time he scrapes his knee.\n\nOn the fence between being amusing and downright inappropriate\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint, AVGN: Game Over can’t be argued with because it is a fan-made game that aims to be anything but serious, but seriously offensive. It uses a retro look with old’school gameplay that work well together and with the rest of the game concept.\n\nIn every level you’ll be punching goombas, Kirbys and a whole lot of characters from popular platformers and not only. In the standalone games, some of the future punching bags are evil characters, others are heroes but in AVGN: Game Over they are all categorically victims.\n\nThe game pushes forward a sense of useless violence that is backed up by a good deal of verbal abuse that just isn’t right. At times cursing a bit can be funny but I’m not sure that this game has that thought in mind.\nDrop the F bomb, literally\n\nThe game is meant to reflect The Angry Video Game Nerd who has made a name for himself for openly bashing games that he considered to be bad. Presentation was everything and that’s also obvious in the game. There is a lot of cursing and to recharge his life essence, he drinks beer just like in real life.\n\nAs a game, AVGN: Game Over is...something. Having repetitive gameplay is an understatement because you can finish the game just by using a single move and the constant ‘F***’ shouts get annoying after a while.\nIf you’re the kind who easily gets frustrated, don’t play this\n\nTo wrap it up, AVGN: Game Over is not something worth recommending. As a game, it’s barely decent and its ‘charm’ solely revolves around the use of trash-talk and downright indecent language.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["LordGavinGames"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1291161600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4bjy.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1040506631","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/AVGN:%20Game%20Over"}]},{"igdb_id":186476,"name":"Avian","summary":"Avian is an adventure game based around a musical instrument that allows you to interact with the dense vegetation of a subterranean world.

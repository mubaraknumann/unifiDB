It's constantly growing and forever inching its way towards anything with body heat. Leaving a wake of poison in its path.\n\nNecromancer: This was once an environmental Purifier. Now mutated into an aimless Necromancer, a lost soul who hovers around beaches, destroying coastlines.\n\nAircleaner: This whirling dervish is actually a highly sophisticated and extremely effective Air Cleaner called the 900-B.

In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn.\nThe game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249—the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.\n\nImage Fight is a 1988 vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Irem. The arcade game was also ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine (Japan-only), Sharp X68000 (Japan-only), and FM Towns (Japan-only) in 1990.\n\nThe player flies a futuristic red ship. R-Type Final identifies this ship as the OF-1 Daedalus, but it is not known if that was the ship's original name. However, the term OF-1 does appear in the NES version's instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, Image Fight II. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the NES version of the game, the first 5 missions are called \"Combat Simulation Stages\" and the last 3 missions are called \"Real Combat Stages\".\n\nTwo separate titles on one very collectable compilation for the shooter fan. X Multiply is similar to Gradius with claustrophobic confines and organic add ons to the ship giving it floaty, stamen like guards. Image Fight is more a chunky R Type tribute with nice multi directional shots and an old school feel. The rarest of the Arcade Gears series.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Irem"],"publishers":["Xing Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":890265600,"platforms":["Sega Saturn","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ims.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"19489","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-19489/"}]},{"igdb_id":43766,"name":"Army Men: Omega Soldier","summary":"Created in a covert laboratory by splicing DNA from the strongest and most skilled soldiers, the \"Omega Soldier\" has been given the strength and weapon skills to become the Tan army's worst high-tech threat!\nArmy Men: Green Rogue incorporates a 3rd person shooter with coin-op shoot 'em style gameplay that will raise the heartbeat of anyone who dares to accept the challenge.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":989712000,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6t2d.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"180625152","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Army%20Men%3A%20Omega%20Soldier"}]},{"igdb_id":43807,"name":"Arkanoid R 2000","summary":"A port for Playstation of the arcade game Arkanoid Returns.

The ultimate mission: seek and destroy the secret Tan weapons factory and perhaps put an end to this struggle for once and for all.\n\nArmy Men: World War - Final Front is another chapter in the popular Army Men series from 3DO, and the sequel to Army Men: World War - Land Sea and Air.

Players will guide the soldier via a third-person, behind-the-back perspective, marching him boldly forward to take on the enemy onslaught.\n\nThe single-player game takes players through five different campaign, each set in a different global location and each with their own specific objectives.

Players will pilot tanks, jeeps, cargo trucks, motorcycles, and submarines in their quest to destroy the enemy supply and weapon lines.\n\nIn Multiplayer mode, two players are able to compete in head-to-head action or team up against the computer. Capture the Flag is included, is Grudge Match, which simply lets them blow each other up until only one is left standing.

The game can be played with 2-6 players, any combination of which can be either human or AI controlled. There is no real sound in Armada 2525, save for the occasional system beep. Game play can be either open ended or set to a specified number turns. There is no set objective to gameplay (except for your 4X's) and the story line is almost non-existant: It is the year 2525 and as your race begins its first step in extra-planetary colonization, you discover that you are not alone in the galaxy. You must compete with up to 5 other races in colonizing planets, and the near lack of diplomatic interaction in the game pretty much insures that you will need to build defenses early on. Unlike Master of Orion, diplomacy only occurs when an opponent requests peace, but you cannot make such requests yourself.\n\nArmada 2525 offers a fair assortment of ships (approx. 20) and buildings (approx. 15), which can only be built after the appropriate technological advance. One can build research labs which are dedicated to one of eight available scientific fields: weapons, construction, hyperspace, force fields, biotech, planetology, info science, and psycho science. Combat can be controlled to an extent - though you cannot affect the individual actions of ships, you can issue general orders and arrange them into formations.\n\nYour race will start at a predetermined homeworld from which it will expand to colonize new solar systems in the usual 4X quest of exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating of your opponents.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":665366400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5yvs.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"13284","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-13284/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"12185","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Armada%202525"}]},{"igdb_id":50488,"name":"Armed Forces Corp.","summary":"The war on terror is raging.

This ammo is limited, but you can increase it if you find extra toothpaste tubes of matching colour. Also watch out for secrets and bonus tooth care gel tubes that can be found in levels, often in secret places.\n\nThe game is made on a very professional level, with cartoon-like pre-rendered sprites for the characters and the bacteria that look like characters from a kids' TV show. German players call platform games \"jump & run\", and here you'll be doing a lot of jumping and running to a catchy tune. Aro & Elmi can be recommended to players of all ages, and knowledge of German is not required (there will be quizzes between some levels on how to properly brush your teeth, but these will not let you fail even if you give a wrong answer).

However, three of these tiles must be destroyed to activate such power-ups - B creates a temporary barrier around the ship,P upgrades the primary weapon and L gives the player an extra bonus at the end of each stage. Another interesting twist to the game is the Uoru armor; a shadow sometimes appear on the ground and if the player aligns his own shadow with it, then the ship transforms into a powerful robot for a short amount of time. Each stage ends with the same boss battle; a large Mega Argus fortress with a slow flashing core at its center, and the only way to destroy this pernicious mothership is to bomb its core when it is fully exposed.

It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game. The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety. By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":535939200,"platforms":["Family Computer","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7o2j.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":273037,"name":"Arkanoid","summary":"Amstrad CPC Port of Arkanoid.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Imagine Software","Ocean Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ct5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":273038,"name":"Arkanoid","summary":"Atari 8-bit port of Arkanoid.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Imagine Software","Ocean"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9f7j.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":273039,"name":"Arkanoid","summary":"ZX Specturm port of Arkanoid.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Imagine Software","Ocean"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["ZX Spectrum"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9f7q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":273042,"name":"Arkanoid","summary":"BBC Micro port of Arkanoid.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Imagine Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["BBC Microcomputer System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9f7i.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":273043,"name":"Arkanoid","summary":"Arkanoid is the official Coco version of the arcade hit of the same name.

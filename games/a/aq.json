[{"igdb_id":45380,"name":"Aquales","summary":"In the year 2069, the British ship \"Elias Rits\" sailed to Kermadec Island on a private investigation mission. Shortly thereafter, satellites reported that beacon transmissions from the ship have stopped. Seeing that further investigation required exploration of hostile environment and deep sea, the authorities dispatched a special team known as W-ODL to find out what has happened to the ship. Navigating a powerful mecha, the American pilot Fredric von Nyuya has to get to the bottom of the mystery and report his findings to the crew.\n\nAquales is an action platformer. The mecha is equipped with a default fist-like melee weapon and gains access to other methods of destruction later, including chainguns, rockets, homing missiles, and more exotic items such as a gravity flamethrower. The stages usually consist of series of platforms and are fairly large, with optional areas and power-ups (health, one-time attacks, etc.) in treasure chests. The protagonist's stand-out equipment is the grappling hook, which must be used frequently to access high platforms. The game also has a light RPG angle: the hero gains experience points from defeating enemies and levels up as a result. Each stage ends with a boss battle, after which the player's progress is saved.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Exact"],"publishers":["Exact"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":687225600,"platforms":["Sharp X68000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6x2y.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":8642,"name":"Aqua Kitty: Milk Mine Defender","summary":"Due to a sudden shortage of milk, cats around the world are forced to seek out new sources to get their fix.

Along the way you must avoid fish, sea horses, and other underwater creatures attempting to block your path. Your diver came prepared however, for he is armed with a spear gun which he can use to temporarily kill one of the creatures. However, each enemy you kill is soon replaced by a faster and indestructible version of itself, so you need to carefully carve a path to the bottom only destroying the creatures that get in your way. After retrieving the treasure and returning it to the top of the cavern, a mermaid will appear. Touching the mermaid will take you to the next level, where you get to do it all over again. At the top of the screen there is a turtle, which shows how much air you have left.

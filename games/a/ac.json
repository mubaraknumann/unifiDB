To stop the evil Dr. X and his army of robots that have been attacking cities across the globe, Action Force seek out his secret hideout, Island X. Dropped on different parts of the island, Action Man, Redwolf and Flint must first find each other, and then put an end to the evil doctor's plans.\n\nMost of the game's 17 levels take the form of a side-scrolling platformer with a heavy action focus. To get to the level exit, the controlled character must jump pits and gaps, climb ledges and take out many enemies, different varieties of X' robots and various animals native to the island: spiders, bats, even dinosaurs. Each character has slightly different abilities (until the finale, which hero is controlled depends on the level): Native American Redwolf always carries his bow, while Action Man and Flint start most levels with only their fists. They can pick up weapons, though, including throwing discs (for Action Man only), several different guns (which can be further enhanced by timed power-ups) and a boomerang (for Australian Flint only). Only Flint can double jump. Picking up 50 Action Man icons gives an extra life. Regular extra lives and health power-ups are also available, and a reset checkpoint is available every few screens.\n\nVariety from the platform levels comes in two levels where Flint uses his dirt rider and Redwolf surfs the waves. These are seen from behind the heroes as they must avoid or blast away obstacles and collect Action Man icons. Action Man lives up to his name in a level where he rides a motorcycle up a volcano (shooting missiles at enemies and jumping across gaps) and another one where he straps helicopter blades to his back to fly towards the level end.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":["Magic Pockets"],"publishers":["Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1095984000,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gc6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":327450,"name":"Acid Web","summary":"Defend your web from an onslaught of strange creatures to the beat of a dynamic, generative acid techno soundtrack in this all-nonsense arcade-style twin stick shooter.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1743465600,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co99tm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":34610,"name":"ACE Academy","summary":"ACE Academy is a slice-of-life, story-centric comedy game with elements of dating-sim; fully voiced and extensively interactive!","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Sport","Adventure","Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["PixelFade"],"publishers":["PixelFade"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1471824000,"platforms":["Linux","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2pdh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":367847,"name":"Achievement Hunter: Princess","summary":"Achievement Hunter: Princess\n\nIn this 2d action / shooter you will play for the princess who wants to stop the snail who are trying to destroy his city.\nYou do not have any allies.

However, this is not enough because - depending on the damage taken - it first has to be built up again. The time this takes depend on various factors, e.g. what other near targets are available, and can be sped up with supply drops by transport aircraft. Available ground installments also have other effects, e.g. the availability of ammo or troops.\n\nThe majority of of the action is fought in the air with World War II aircraft, but there are also ground (e.g. tanks) and naval vehicles available. The matches itself are of a grand scale and can take multiple hours; afterwards the map is reset. Overall the controls are somewhere between simulation and action. Depending on the arena, which can also be crafted with the editor, the exact winning conditions can be slightly different. While the multiplayer matches are subscription-based, there is also a free offline mode for training included.\n\nIn the years after release, the game was under continuous development and saw many minor and major changes.

After this, it's on to the third-person action levels, where you control Action Man from behind the back as he makes his way through enemy territory, and must occasionally solve puzzles to get out of whatever predicament he's found himself in this time.\n\nThe game's levels feature a myriad of locales, from evil villains' bases to the burning sands of the desert to the arctic chill of the North Pole. You'll face many of Action Man's most notorious fiends during the adventure. You have a host of weapons, from your trusty hand-gun to automatic weapons and even a sniping rifle.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Blitz Games"],"publishers":["Hasbro Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":961891200,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co290c.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":176951,"name":"Acolyte: Ascend","summary":"A bitsy interactive fiction game with a hint of dating sim about an acolyte and their deity reckoning with the end of the world.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["skiddyhale"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1593475200,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5uvr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":237608,"name":"Action Ninja Dash","summary":"Action Ninja Dash","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":184960,"name":"A Child's Courage","summary":"A 2D rogue-like with horror elements","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1611187200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":249637,"name":"A Conscious Decision","summary":"You are a wisp of consciousness in Jane's mind.

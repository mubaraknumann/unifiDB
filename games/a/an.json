These hardened military professionals, tired of bureaucracy, politics and serving the armed forces, have established a private paramilitary formation located in south United States. Being true military professionals, they periodically execute contracts for jobs that may not be considered “clean”.\n\nThe Team consists of many complex individuals with their own back story, but they do not shun mercenary applicants. Members of the team are idealists; they dwell on moral issues, as well as question blind nationalism, etc. AntiSquad strongly differ from military units. They truly are a bunch of contradictions put together - heartfelt cynics, gregarious egoists, aggressive pacifists, and phlegmatic rebels all under one banner.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["InsGames"],"publishers":["BulkyPix","Plug In Digital"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1400716800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fzzvtr20zck4xt17lkyn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":385433,"name":"An Automaton's Journey","summary":"Play as the ancient automaton Cecilia Immergreen as you explore the world for secrets, solve puzzles, delve into dungeons, fight other Hololive members as powerful bosses, help other members with side quests, and find powerful items to explore previously unavailable locations.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coba76.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":318180,"name":"A Night With: Spirit","summary":"Trapped within an old television, a ghostly girl with a mysterious past, awaits a player who can help her break free.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Visual Novel"],"developers":["NaughtyNarratives"],"publishers":["NaughtyNarratives"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1725494400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8wsl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":76591,"name":"Angel's Present: A Marl Kingdom Story","summary":"Rhapsody III: Memories of Marl Kingdom is a role-playing video game developed and published by Nippon Ichi Software for the PlayStation 2.

The game had to be completely reimplemented because the code of Anstoss 3 was considered too confused to be able to use it. This, as well as the short development time of only 12 months, meant that the program suffered from a large number of bugs that made it almost unplayable. Furthermore, the text and 3D mode was seen as too weak by the fan base and the manufacturer Ascaron was asked to make significant improvements. The manufacturer decided not to fix the program errors with patches, but rather to bring a new, revised manager onto the market based on Anstoss 4.\n\nAnstoss 4 is therefore considered to be the worst part of the Anstoss series, as it could not shine through playability, realism, or wit. Although the new database system, which now contained 145 countries, to which four leagues could be added, was praised by the manufacturer, it tended to cause very long waiting times, which massively delayed the game.\n\nAnstoss 4 differed from its predecessors not least in that the two main developers Gerald Köhler and Rolf Langenberg left the Ascaron team and switched to the competition from EA Sports to develop the soccer manager series there. Since then, the fan community has also split into two camps.\n\nAscaron was sued by its competitor Electronic Arts for license infringement shortly before the publication of Anstoss 4 and had to crush the entire CD production and change all player names.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Ascaron"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1041292800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2lyb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":317042,"name":"Another Random Idle RPG","summary":"ARI is a browser RPG game, where you have to manage a team of heroes to defeat a dungeon full of monsters","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["CREADIV"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Web browser","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8ty2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":108867,"name":"Ankora: Lost Days","summary":"Discover the planet of Ankora in a single-player survival adventure with exploration and crafting.

Now there was a bar in the lower part of the screen, which led the player through the individual screens.\n\nAnstoss 2 specialized again completely in the job of the club manager.

Innerhalb eines Jahres verkaufte es sich mehr als 200.000 Mal. Von den Spielemagazinen wurde es mit guten Wertungen bedacht (z. B. PC Player 87 %, Gamestar 88 %, PC Games 86 %).\nJedoch war es zu Beginn geradezu gefüllt mit Bugs, was von der Spielergemeinde kritisiert wurde. Dennoch wurde es von den Anstoss-Fans mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, da es die wichtigsten Elemente von Anstoss 2 Gold enthielt und diese noch weiter vertiefen konnte.\nAls besonders gelungen gilt die 3D-Spieldarstellung. Der Spieler konnte sich ein komplettes Spiel seines Teams reduziert auf neun Minuten ansehen. Auch der Szenenmodus galt als revolutionär, da die Szenen nicht, wie in den Vorgängerteilen, vorberechnet wurden. Kommentiert wurden die Spielszenen durch den bekannten Fußballkommentator Günther Koch.\nAuch neu war die Umsetzung des Vereinsgeländes. Von Apfelbäumen über Konditionsparcours und Doping-Labor bis hin zu Wolkenkratzern konnte der Spieler sein Vereinsgelände mit Gebäuden, Gegenständen und Lebewesen mit und ohne Nutzen erweitern.\nMit der Veröffentlichung des finalen Patches auf Version 1.40 wurde es nahezu bugfrei und konnte die Anstoss-Spieler überzeugen. Insgesamt wurden bis heute über eine Million Exemplare von Anstoss 3 verkauft und machen es damit zu einem der erfolgreichsten PC-Spiele Deutschlands. Trotz seines Alters wird Anstoss 3 durch die große Spieltiefe zusammen mit einem gelungenen Text- und 3D-Modus als bester Teil der Anstoss-Reihe angesehen. Dass Anstoss 3 auch heute noch sehr beliebt ist, hängt auch mit dem Multiplayermodus zusammen. So wird es bis zu 4 Spielern ermöglicht, im Netzwerk gegeneinander anzutreten.","genres":["Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Ascaron Entertainment"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":959817600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7ky3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":82691,"name":"A Naive Villager Girl Nako's Exploration Story","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1506470400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ipu.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":207560,"name":"Animosa","summary":"Journey alongside the timid knight through this challenging metroidvania full of unique bosses and dynamic enemies.

In each place, Pooka has a specific task that will help Anya reach her goal, ranging from contacts with Dmitri to creating passports and helping a Prima Ballerina find her lucky ballet slippers. Throughout the journey, you must also avoid Rasputin's minions who will zap Pooka into the underworld and make him play deadly games to escape. While underground, Pooka is challenged to several games including Doggy Dodge (dodge rocks), Minion Mosh (a jumping game similar to Fox and Geese), Skull Toss (bowling-like game using Rasputin's denizens as targets) and Hidden Maze. In the latter, you see a maze for a short time and then try and guide Pooka safely through to the other side. Between locations, you hear entries from Anya's diary and after the game is completed, you're rewarded with screenshots from the movie.

The player's behavior does determine the mental health of the main character and change locations and unveil new secrets leading to different endings.\n\nOn 13 April 2013, the Extended Edition was released which added new environments, puzzles, user interface, music, improved graphics, and a new character.\n\nPLOT:\nThe storyline of Anna concerns an amnesiac man who dreams of a sawmill in the mountains near his town. He decides to go there to find out its connection to his missing memories and a woman named \"Anna\" who seems to be calling out for him, and enters the house by solving puzzles in the garden. He becomes aware that the house is haunted after seeing several strange phenomena.\n\nAs the protagonist explores, he begins to hear voices belonging to himself and the eponymous Anna, among others. Through these voices and texts found throughout the sawmill, he discovers that he has had an obsessive history with an ancient deity named Anna that he had since forgotten. However, the plot is ambiguous from this point; one interpretation holds that in times of yore, Anna would lure men into worship, causing them to murder those close to them or starve themselves at the feet of her statue, and after she seduced the protagonist, he murdered his own wife and children for threatening his relationship with Anna. The other interpretation paints the protagonist as the villain, meeting a human avatar of Anna in the forest and falling in love with her. However, after she left because of his obsession with her and abusive personality, he sacrificed children to summon her again.\n\nThe game has three main endings; in an inversion of the norm, the more effort that is put into achieving an ending, the less optimistic the conclusion will be. In the first scenario, the protagonist concludes that Anna was burnt as a witch centuries ago and leaves the house, vowing never to return. In the second ending, the protagonist reminisces about Anna, realizes that he cannot live without her, and opens himself up to possession by her, joining the multitude of mannequins that are found throughout the house. In the third ending, the protagonist remembers killing his real wife after she defiled Anna's statue, and finds the statue, along with dolls of his children, in a small chamber. As the tunnel to the chamber caves in, he realizes that he will stay in the chamber forever, but he does not care because he has \"Anna\" with him.\n\nThe plot is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of the protagonist as to whether or not the sawmill is real or merely a dream, as well as the strange phenomena that occur throughout the story and the vague and unconnected nature of the voices.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nDreampainters, the development studio, based the story on legends from the Val D'Ayas region of Italy, particularly one about a sawmill where a lumberjack killed his family. They claimed that the game's focus was on mystery-solving and exploration, with the player being able to discover the plot at their own pace. One of Anna's particularly infamous features, the ability to pick up any object (no matter if it will be used later on in the game), was apparently based on the developers' hatred for adventure games and cartoons where the important objects were made more obvious to the viewer.\n\nAnna would reportedly have a feature whereby the game would interpret the player's actions to try and scare them; for example, if a player focused on a particular object for too long, that object would appear more often. However, no such feature appeared in the game. Dreampainters also claimed that the extent of the protagonist's descent into madness would determine the ending, but the ending was actually determined by when the player decided to leave the sawmill.\n\nRECEPTION:\nAnna received mixed reviews from critics. The graphics, story and sound were praised, but it was criticized for the obscurity of its narrative, complexity of its interface, and difficulty of its puzzles. The horror elements were both praised and criticized by different reviews; IGN said that the lack of death removed any sense of threat, while Zero Punctuation praised the horror but claimed the immersion was broken by the necessity of a walkthrough. It received a score of 49.13% on GameRankings and 55/100 on Metacritic.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Dreampainters Software"],"publishers":["Kalypso Media"],"aggregated_rating":60.0,"release_date":1341964800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8izk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":222652,"name":"Anya's Dodgeball Challenge","summary":"Anya's Dodgeball Challenge is a promotional web game based on Spy × Family.","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["COLOPL, Inc."],"publishers":["COLOPL, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1658880000,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5mu5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":45441,"name":"AnEarth Fantasy Stories: The First Volume","summary":"AnEarth Fantasy Stories: The First Volume (エイナスファンタジーストーリーズ ザ・ファーストボリューム) is an RPG for the Sega Saturn.

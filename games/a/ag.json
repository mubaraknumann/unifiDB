Players accomplish this by exploring their surroundings, conquering other civilisations and accumulating wealth. Key elements include building and controlling units and managing resources.\nAge of Empires 2: The Age of Kings starts the player out in the Dark Ages, roughly when Age of Empires ends. The goal remains the same: use advanced technology and troops to establish your civilisation's dominance. But now the player has better toys: each of the 13 civilisations have unique buildings, soldiers and advantages. The Teutons have Knights, for instance, while the Vikings have Berserkers. Winning the game requires military dominance or the construction of wonders of the world. The single-player game is fun, but most players love Age of Empires 2 for its wildly popular multiplayer component. Thousands of civilisations rise and fall every day as gamers around the world compete in matches over the Internet.\n\nThis bundle includes Age of Empires: Gold Edition, containing the original Age of Empires and Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome Expansion, plus Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings and Age of Empires II: The Conqueror's Expansion. The bundle is great for fans of the series to have all of the titles in one place; and for newbies it is less expensive than buying all the titles separately.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Ensemble Studios"],"publishers":["Microsoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":972864000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co80ri.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":350678,"name":"A Game About Mining Rocks","summary":"A Game About Mining Rocks is a single-player survival game where you mine rocks, gather minerals, sell them, and upgrade your gear to explore deeper.

Commissioned and funded by SEGA, development was started by French developer No Cliché, which was acquired by SEGA in 1997.Creative direction was done by Frédérick Raynal, a pioneering figure in the establishment of the survival horror genre with the influential Alone In the Dark series. Development started in 2000 (possibly earlier, in 1999), although references to the game can be found as early as 1998. The name of the game itself is a city, which, according to esotericist literature, resides in the core of planet earth.\n\nIntending to release in 2001, this coincided with SEGA's decision to discontinue the production of the Dreamcast. On January 30 2001, SEGA announced that no more Dreamcast consoles would be manufactured. Games that were already in development at that time were supposed to be brought to completion however. In spite of that announcement, Agartha never reached that state of development. No Cliché stopped development on as per order of SEGA Europe and ceased to exist soon after. Sometime between May 26 and July 22 of 2001.\n\nIn 2008, the website unseen64, dedicated to documenting the history of unreleased video games, created an article about Agartha, documenting the little information that is known about the game. In the comments, one or more developers shared some memories and insights developing the game.\n\nThe website also acquired a clip of 15 minutes very early in-game footage, displaying the eerie mood and the technical and graphical prowess of No Cliché.\n\nIn 2018, an E3 Build was made available online.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["No Cliché"],"publishers":["Sega"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xav.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":370580,"name":"A Game About Feeding A Black Hole","summary":"A short incremental game about feeding a Black Hole matter by destroying Asteroids, Planets, and Stars.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["Aarimous Studios LLC"],"publishers":["Aarimous Studios LLC"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1765756800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coakre.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":16134,"name":"Age of Steel: Recharge","summary":"\"Age of Steel: Recharge\" is a 2D strategy with a view from the side.

Gameplay is 4X-based (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate) where players explore the world map, slowly building an empire through colonization, warfare and diplomacy with rival powers. However new to III is the greater addition of role-playing game features, where players must first choose and customize their leader, all options dependant on the player's chosen style of play. There are six available races in the initial release: humans, draconians, high elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins, all that will determine the race of their empire with each having unique perks and abilities. The leader and empire is further shaped by the choice from skill sets based on traditional RPG classes along with further specializations and skills to select. Each leader class also has access to their own unique units with a distinct visual look based on their corresponding race, each to accommodate their own unique approach to strategy, both in combat and when managing their empire. On release there are six different classes a leader can be. The \"Sorcerer\" class emphasizes the use of magic for enchantments and summoning powerful units. The \"Theocrat\" derives from an organized religion based society including zealots followers and the use of holy spells and warriors. The \"Rogue\" favors less direct approaches to situations, employing stealth, thievery and manipulation aswell as dark magic in diplomacy and warfare. The \"Archdruid\" channels the power of nature, using it to their advantage by being very self-sufficient and being able to call upon wild creatures. The \"Dreadnaught\" leads a steampunk styled society, using large industry, machinery and gunpowder-based units like cannons and tanks. Finally the \"Warlord\" specializes in direct conflict and combat tactics, utilizing effective non-magic based units and abilities.\nLeaders themselves and separate recruitable hero units will be able to gain experience and level up, while also being able to gain new equipment and powers. Players can also develop their alignment between good and evil based on their player's actions and the cultures the player absorbs into their empire, rather than race like the previous games in the series.\nCities themselves provide much of the resources, infrastructure and host to unit recruitment. Independent cities and units not immediately aligned to any player/leader are also present in the world map. Units that come from an unaffiliated city will fight to protect a city's domain, and they won't forget that they're tied to it. Many of these independent settlements aren't cities in the traditional sense, but can be alternative settlements, like a \"Giant's Keep\" for example. The player can conquer these holdings, which will provide units like a city, or they can absorb them through diplomatic means by paying tribute and diplomatic and/or alignment standing. Quests can also be given to players by independent forces and cities, including but not limited to clearing out wild units, searching for relics and even conquering cities and other holdings.

Based upon the gameplay of the Age of Empires series, it was originally developed by Robot Entertainment, but on February 24, 2011, Gas Powered Games, took over production. The game was published by Microsoft.\n\nThe game was free-to-play—it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, the game premiered on Steam after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the Celtic civilization. On June 15, 2012 the premium content system was changed to offer the option to purchase all past and future content through \"Empire points\" earned in game, or by purchasing the points directly with real world money.\n\nAs of January 3, 2013, Microsoft ceased further development on the game. A Microsoft representative later announced on the forums that on August 22, 2013, the Games for Windows – Live Marketplace would be shut down, leaving the game only accessible by current or former players. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014 when the service would be shut down. The closure was due to the content being too expensive to maintain.\n\nIn 2017, Age of Empires Online was reestablished using Microsoft's publicly released developer-kit for the game and is now hosted on a server emulator known as \"Project Celeste\". The game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft's unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed. It was finalized and released on March 14th, 2021","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Gas Powered Games","Robot Entertainment"],"publishers":["Microsoft Game Studios"],"aggregated_rating":68.75,"release_date":1313452800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1xy0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":324981,"name":"Agent Fall","summary":"Infiltrate and destroy in side-scrolling shooter style!","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Adventure","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Pufferfish Digital"],"publishers":["Eastasiasoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1738108800,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co94ti.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":50919,"name":"Age of Empires III: Gold Edition","summary":"Age of Empires III Gold Edition combines the exciting Age of Empires III and its respective expansion pack, Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs for one compelling gaming experience at a great value.\n\nAge of Empires III gives players the opportunity to pick up where Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings left off, placing them in the time period of roughly 1500-1850.

However, after the assassination of the Human king, the Humans believe that the Jaar are responsible for their leader's death and form a faction with their allying races: The Elves, Jin'tulu, and Dryads; forming the faction known as The Arbiters. The Jaar take this as a declaration of war, and form their own faction with their allies, the Gnomes, Dark Elves, and Orcs, which became known as the 2nd Legion. These two factions both believe that the other is the aggressor, and desire to kill all of those who are affiliated with them. And so, the Great War begins. \n  \nThe war between the two factions causes massive destruction, slaughtering of innocents, and hatred throughout the planet of Uloff. The two faction leaders, King Earnet of the Arbiters and Warlord Bjorin of the 2nd Legion, decide that they will not win the war without a game-changing asset. They then realize that an individual known as the Faction Champion could change the war, and both leaders call in new recruits in order to test and train to see which one will be worthy to become the Faction Champion.

The player takes control over one of these barbarian tribes, who as a whole stood out for a pronounced lack of cultural achievements, combined with a ferocious belligerence. Skirmishes, raids and plunderings were the order of the day for these barbarians and are, therefore, the great theme of this game. \n \nBased in a small village, the player and his barbarians roam the vast forests of Germania or the barren steppes of eastern Europe to raid other settlements in their search for food, weapons and gold. These resources will help the barbarian chieftain expand his settlement and, above all, increase his reputation. While his tribe grows and flourishes, the leader obtains fame and experience and grows to be a master of warfare, until the player's barbarian empire is finally ready to take on the superpower of the time - the mighty Roman Empire and its apparently invincible army.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"developers":["Independent Arts Software"],"publishers":["Encore Software Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1083715200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e2ase85vspkdj8xpxtbk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":54693,"name":"AG Drive","summary":"Fast-paced futuristic racing game","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1424304000,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co84mi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":136153,"name":"Age of Wonders: Planetfall - Day One Edition","summary":"In Age of Wonders: Planetfall, players will explore the remnants of the Star Union, once a vast empire connecting thousands of worlds, but its people have been left isolated and stranded following the Collapse.

New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.\n\nAt harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!\n\nThe player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family’s home, for the number of family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards.

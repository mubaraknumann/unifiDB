Modes include Championship, Single Race, and Time Attack. The main mode is the Championship mode which lets the player compete in an underground ATV championship circuit which is being held amongst the French Alps. The player's goal is to win the races by any means necessary. The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player's vehicle. Examples of weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Deibus Studios"],"publishers":["Gotham Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1058918400,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i3uk8qayflc4om9oqixn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":57887,"name":"ATV Renegades","summary":"Arcade racing across the globe with local split-screen multiplayer and 24 off-road courses.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Renegade Kid"],"publishers":["Nighthawk Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1492473600,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zub.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":58083,"name":"A Tough Sell","summary":"A text adventure game.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xmtbjppt9x2zx0nqtjif.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"54799","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-54799/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"507991","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/A%20Tough%20Sell"}]},{"igdb_id":58086,"name":"A Tale of Caos: Prelude","summary":"A point-and-click adventure game.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cxvxe6gf9l2lkihef680.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"54796","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-54796/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"507988","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/A%20Tale%20of%20Caos%3A%20Prologue"}]},{"igdb_id":58400,"name":"Atmocopter","summary":"A mix of atmosphere and helicopter from unTied Games","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1483142400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pzj6v1e1u2agarldhu5g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":58775,"name":"Attack of the Zolgear","summary":"Attack of the Zolgear is an arcade game for one to six players released by Namco.

When you encounter a game in the Timeline, you can immediately play it without losing your place.\n\nThe massive list of games spans six original Atari console and home computer platforms and generations of arcade titles, the most ever included in a collection by the team at Digital Eclipse. For the first time ever, games from the cult favorite Atari Jaguar and Atari Lynx platforms will be playable on modern consoles. Behind every game are the stories of Atari, what was happening at the company, what went into the creation of the games and the hardware on which they ran, all told by the people who were there. It is a rare opportunity to get a rich behind-the-scenes look at the history of video games.\n\nIn addition to presenting these Atari classics exactly as they were, the talented team at Digital Eclipse has also created the Reimagined series—six new games that revisit, mash-up and reimagine Atari Classics. Each of these new games is included in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.","genres":["Fighting","Shooter","Platform","Puzzle","Racing","Simulator","Sport","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Pinball","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Digital Eclipse"],"publishers":["Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":83.0,"release_date":1668124800,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4xgf.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1919470","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919470"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD5RRBRC","url":"https://amazon.de/dp/B0BD5RRBRC"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10004884","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004884"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"9N3TFDSQ531T","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/-1-/9N3TFDSQ531T"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1256432987","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BB7V8W97","url":"https://amazon.it/dp/B0BB7V8W97"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BCWR29CX","url":"https://amazon.fr/dp/B0BCWR29CX"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BCWKSDKG","url":"https://amazon.it/dp/B0BCWKSDKG"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BCWKSDKG","url":"https://amazon.fr/dp/B0BCWKSDKG"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BCWKSDKG","url":"https://amazon.es/dp/B0BCWKSDKG"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"amzn1.adg.product.bd025fb5-fd20-492f-b34b-535624ea6bfe","url":"https://play.amazon.com/play?gid=amzn1.adg.product.bd025fb5-fd20-492f-b34b-535624ea6bfe&territory=US&r=web&ref=igdb"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD5SMCN9","url":"https://amazon.de/dp/B0BD5SMCN9"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BB7V8W97","url":"https://amazon.fr/dp/B0BB7V8W97"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD1RMJPB","url":"https://amazon.es/dp/B0BD1RMJPB"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD5RRBRC","url":"https://amazon.de/dp/B0BD5RRBRC"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD5V46VB","url":"https://amazon.de/dp/B0BD5V46VB"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD21YV95","url":"https://amazon.es/dp/B0BD21YV95"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BGPTFL1Q","url":"https://amazon.fr/dp/B0BGPTFL1Q"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD5RLVHK","url":"https://amazon.de/dp/B0BD5RLVHK"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BD1TH1ZV","url":"https://amazon.es/dp/B0BD1TH1ZV"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"amzn1.adg.product.bd025fb5-fd20-492f-b34b-535624ea6bfe","url":"https://play.amazon.com/play?gid=amzn1.adg.product.bd025fb5-fd20-492f-b34b-535624ea6bfe&territory=US&r=web&ref=igdb"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"B0BB81M854","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BB81M854"}]},{"igdb_id":207035,"name":"Atai no Gensoukyou","summary":"Atai no Gensokyo is a fan-made Touhou Project-roguelike game created by AQUA STYLE.

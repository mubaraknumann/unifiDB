It includes a new level cap of 70 for adventurers and artisans, new items and quests, new monsters to fight, alternate ways of advancing your character (achievement points) and the ability to increase a guild to level 50. \n \nPurchase of the expansion granted each character in any account that bought the expansion an Aviak hatchling. If the expansion was bought in a brick and mortar store, the account is granted one Carnivorous plant. The Carnivorous Plant acts as a house pet which can be fed items from the world, and depending on what is fed to it, will yield a useful item. \n \nThe Overrealm is composed of floating islands which originate from the Plane of Sky. Transportation to the Overrealm works like in The Shadows of Luclin; when a player wishes to go there, he or she obtains a teleportation shard from the overseer of a wizard spire on the ground. The overseer NPC then grants to the player character a teleportation shard which flags the player as one wanting to go to the Overrealm. Every five minutes, the spires activate, sending player characters to the Overrealm. If a player originates in Antonica or the Commonlands, he or she will be sent to the Tenebrous Tangle. If a player originates in the Thundering Steppes or Nektulos Forest, then he or she is sent to the Barren Sky. If the player originates in the Enchanted Lands or the Feerrott, he or she is sent to the Bonemire. \n \nAs with both the original game and the first expansion, a new epic quest line is included called the \"Claymore\" line. The start of this quest line can be completed solo in the outdoor areas, however, it will soon require a group and many segments require large investments of time \"camping\" the required NPCs to spawn and gain quest updates. The last parts of this quest must be completed within a raid (a group of 7+ players), the first being in an area known as \"Ascent of the Awakened\" in which you must have two groups (12 players). The final part takes place in Deathtoll, a zone intended for four groups (24 players), and requires an epic access quest in itself to enter. In the end players got to choose from an archetype specific reward (in some cases there are multiple choices) which at the current time was some of the (arguably) best items in the game. \n \nOnce a player has installed this expansion pack and reaches adventuring level 10, a character is granted achievement experience through discovering new areas, finding precious treasure and status items, killing monsters with specific names, completing select quests, and completing certain collections of items.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Sony Online Entertainment"],"publishers":["Sony Online Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":72.5,"release_date":1140480000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uojm9bi2fulrcdhsp1cs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":204657,"name":"EverCrawl","summary":"EverCrawl is a bite-sized puzzle roguelike.\n\nIn EverCrawl the only way is forward.

The expansion comprises an assortment of otherworldly planes that do not exist in a planetary sense within the EverQuest universe. \n \nThe expansion added content to the game aimed specifically toward the high-end player. In addition to adding new zones to the game, the expansion also introduced a network of portal points through the game realm. Players could use them to quickly travel to and from various regions through a central plane, known as Plane of Knowledge. \n \nThe primary goal, or end-quest, of The Planes of Power is access to the Plane of Time. Access to this plane can only be obtained through vanquishing the four elemental deities or avatars of such: Fennin Ro, The Rathe Council, Coirnav and Xegony. To gain access to all of the zones of the expansion and successfully enter the Plane of Time, the players needed to complete 28 flag events of all sorts, involving the death of planar deities and deific creatures. These encounters can only be completed with the organized effort of up to 72 players working together simultaneously. \n \nIn order to enter the expansion's basic zones, a player had to reach the former set planar level of 46. From there, one had to complete tasks to gain access to the more advanced zones. It was later changed so that once the character reached level 55 they gained access to two more zones which are the Plane of Valor and the Plane of Storms. At 62 the Bastion of Thunder then became available. Those level limits can be bypassed by completing the progression of the expansion, allowing for example to be level 46 while adventuring in the Bastion of Thunder. The maximum level was increased from 60 to 65 with this expansion and new Particle Weapons were added, when before only epic weapons had such visual effects.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Sony Online Entertainment"],"publishers":["Sony Online Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1035849600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1h4s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":57453,"name":"EverQuest: Empires of Kunark","summary":"Empires of Kunark is the twenty-third expansion for EverQuest","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Daybreak Game Company"],"publishers":["Daybreak Game Company"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1479254400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1h5a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":226848,"name":"Evil Genius 2: World Domination - Team Fortress 2: Pyro Pack","summary":"The Pyro is a dangerous, uncontrollable force of destruction who acts without regard for the lives of those around them.

Herbert (their baby son) also appeared in the game as a mobile hazard NPC. The player cannot freely change character; the player begins in control of Wally and in order to switch must be on the same screen as the desired character. Those not being controlled by the player wander randomly around the map controlled by extremely simple AI - another feature that at the time had never been seen before. Lives and health (called \"endurance\") were tracked independently for each character, but the game ended if any character died.\n\nThe aim of the game is to complete a day's worth of work for each character; each character has a job to do stereotypical of their skill - for instance, Wally has to build a wall, Wilma has to take back three books to the library, etc. Completing the job awards the character with a letter, which spells out a password to open a safe holding everyone's wages. The eventual password is \"BREAK\" - knowing this does not spoil the game since most of the letters can be seen before jobs are complete; the game requires them to be actually collected before allowing the safe to open.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Mikro-Gen Ltd"],"publishers":["Mikro-Gen Ltd"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":478483200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u8fjj0erycka2dumw1os.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":329448,"name":"Ever 17/Never 7 Double Pack","summary":"Stand up to the fate of infinity!","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1741219200,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9i1l.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":329457,"name":"Evaluate","summary":"This game provides players with a simple yet highly attractive stress relieving experience.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1739318400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9bpe.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":161378,"name":"Eviron's Chronicles","summary":"Eviron's Chronicle - a free collectible card game with elements of RPG.

Finally, CCP added a Sansha Mothership, the Revenant, Fighter-bombers, the Noctis salvaging vessel, improvements to NPCs and their AI, new loot and rewards, storyline events and a more dynamic and simplified system for Planetary Interaction. The web-based social networking platform, EVE Gate, and the official forums received updates in the Incursion expansion as well.\n\nCCP released the Incursion expansion in three phases: a first-step patch with a collection of player-requested improvements on November 30, a second-step patch with hidden features before December 25, and a third-step patch that included key features of the expansion (Incarna Character Creator, Sansha Incursions) on January 18, 2011. CCP has stated that this method of implementation prevents a large number of bugs from infiltrating the code, and the key features \"will benefit greatly from an additional level of polish.\"\n\nDuring the second-step patch the learning skills were removed. Players were reimbursed in two ways, they got their invested skill points back which they then could redistribute to their liking or, when they hadn't already inserted the skillbook, they got the NPC price back.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["CCP"],"publishers":["CCP"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1291075200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9c6o.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":329933,"name":"Eve Online: Equinox","summary":"The rejuvenation of nullsec has begun!

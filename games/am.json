This strategy\" game’s concept is simple: pit your army of microscopic organisms against your opponents’ microscopic armies in a free-for-all arena battle. Imagine the game of Risk invented by a mad cellular biologist\n\nYour armies are made up of four types of single-cell soldiers: cytozoids, amoeboids, mitoplasts, and blockers. Each type varies in terms of movement, attack power, health, and ability to reproduce. You start the game with a set number of each organism, which you place in your corner, or “home area,” of the board. Your opponents do the same, and then it's a cytoplasmic slugfest as you pilot your pieces in the arena according to their movement allowances, attacking and defending. The winner is the player with pieces left on the hoard at the end of the battle. It took me less than five minutes to get started playing, but I'm still nowhere near mastering the strategies it takes to win.\n\nThere are three scenarios from which to choose: a quick, basic game or two more-protracted tournament games. Tournament games cycle players through changing game boards as you fight for control over your opponents’ star systems. Win control over them all (or hold the majority in limited round tournaments) and you get to take a victory lap around the AmoebArena starship. In the more complex scenarios, the hoard and the composition of your pieces change between battles, and so does the strategy. Five computer opponents are available, each with a different style of play. It’s also possible to compete against human opponents, but because the human players have to share the same computer (no network play is available), it’s essentially a oneperson game. If you are shopping for a game to play with your friends, choose another.\n\nSurrounding the game board are windows that contain animated portraits of you and your opponents. I found a cheesy sci-fi charm to these graphics and the background data on each player, but they won’t be to everyone’s taste. The windows come to life as you or your opponents react to the fortunes (good and had) of microscopic combat. These prefab personalities, intended to add flavor to the game, are only moderately successful. But I loved the way my animated cell warriors oozed across the board, accompanied by a disgusting sucking sound.\n\nThe Last Word My only real complaints about AmoebArena are that there’s no network option and that you must play it from the CD. This is a simple game, and the movie files that come with it aren't essential. I would have liked to run it from my PowerBook, but there was no option to play without those flics. In the end, though, these are minor quibbles. AmoebArena is an engaging game that’s easy to learn but doesn't lose its slimy charms after just a few games.\"\n\nHawn, Matthew. (January 1996).

However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["C-Dream"],"publishers":["Coconuts Japan"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":622512000,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zcx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":56441,"name":"A Messenger Adventure","summary":"A short Zork inspired piece of interactive fiction played with a chatbot through Facebook Messenger.","genres":[],"developers":["Kilian Valkhof"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1480550400,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vot7dj61okatqr9nzydn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":18244,"name":"American Girl: Dress Designer","summary":null,"genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Mattel Interactive"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":946598400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lwdobcbh5hkjk56t2oy3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":184731,"name":"Amor Fati","summary":"A feel-good micro game about what can be created from nothing","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":239560,"name":"Amaranth","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Fuga System"],"publishers":["Fuga System"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":661132800,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co675a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":158835,"name":"Amazing Pyramids: Rebirth","summary":"Amazing Pyramids are back!

The game is branded as a strategic communication device, designed to allow young Americans to virtually explore the Army at their own pace and according to their interests to determine if soldiering matches their needs, interests and abilities. America's Army represents the first large-scale use of game technology by the U.S. government as a platform for strategic communication and the first use of game technology in support of U.S. Army recruiting.\n\nThe America's Army concept was conceived in 1999 by Colonel Casey Wardynski; the Army's Chief Economist and Professor at the United States Military Academy.[2] Wardynski envisioned \"using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual Soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining.\"[3] America's Army was managed by two other U.S. Army officers serving with Wardynski at the Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA): Major Chris Chambers and Major Bret Wilson.\n\nThe Windows version 1.0, subtitled Recon, was first released on July 4, 2002. As of January 2014, there have been over 41 versions and updates released, including updates to America's Army: Proving Grounds which was released in August 2013. All versions have been developed on the Unreal Engine. The game is financed by the U.S. government and distributed by free download.\n\nAccording to game historian Carrie McLeroy America's Army has \"grown in ways its originators couldn't have imagined\".[3] Dozens of government training and simulation applications using the America's Army platform have been developed to train and educate U.S. Army soldiers.[4] America's Army has also been used to deliver virtual soldiering experiences to participants at events, such as air shows, amusement parks, and sporting events around the country.

He summons his grandchild and tells him about a vision he had, of an old friend who supposedly died more than forty years ago and warned him of a great evil rising again. He sends the youth on a quest to seek that old friend and find out what is behind that vision.\n\nConcerning gameplay, Ambermoon is similar to its predecessor. The player initially controls only the main character, having the choice between a male and a female protagonist with several portraits each, but otherwise unable to customize them at that point. During the course of the game, additional characters may be recruited in various places in Lyramion; up to six form an active party that participates in combat. All characters can train physical attributes by specific NPCs in various towns, while some can also buy, learn, and cast offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Thalion Software"],"publishers":["Thalion Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":757296000,"platforms":["Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coakcg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":170900,"name":"Among Ass 2: Butt Warfare","summary":"Asses are back in an adrenaline-pumping sequel!

It is an unofficial, enhanced remake of Nintendo's Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991), borrowing the art style and overall feeling of the Game Boy Advance game Metroid: Zero Mission (2004). Shortly after the game's release, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting AM2R; download links to the game were removed from its official website, but Guasti said that he still planned to continue working on the game privately. In September 2016, Guasti ended the development of AM2R after he received a DMCA takedown request from Nintendo.\n\nThe game follows Samus Aran, who aims to eradicate the parasitic Metroids from their home planet SR388. It includes several new features, including redone graphics and music, a map system, and new areas and minibosses. The controls were changed to be less \"floaty\", in line with the gameplay of later titles in the series. Video game journalists appreciated the game, frequently calling it impressive and commenting on the improved visuals compared to those of the original Metroid II, although one thought the conditions required to win battles against Metroids were too specific considering how often they occur. The game was nominated for The Game Awards 2016, but was later removed from the nominations page without notice.","genres":["Platform","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["DoctorM64"],"publishers":["DoctorM64"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1470441600,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation Vita"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4oe6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":46035,"name":"AMF: Extreme Bowling","summary":"AMF Xtreme Bowling 2006 is a bowling simulation game.

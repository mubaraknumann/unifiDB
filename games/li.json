It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz).\n\nAt first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two \"arrows\", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a \"season\" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.\n\nAlong the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.\n\nEvery so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.\n\nThe player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":436406400,"platforms":["Arcade","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co306z.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":70945,"name":"Little Princess","summary":"Little Princess is a 1987 text adventure made by Alicesoft's former company Championsoft.

A year ago from the time this game was set, her mother had died from an illness - her father was a famous wizard who died from saving the kingdom when Parfait was young.\n\nAt the beginning, Parfait introduces herself and tells the player that she is almost at the risk of losing her beloved shop (the only remains of her mother), for Parfait has to pay the debt of 1,000,000G (gold) by 12 months to keep the shop running. As a normal shop, there seems no hope for raising the Black Cat Market's fame.\n\nThe player's motive is to collect this debt by 12 months in various ways such as putting cauldron-made potions to the shop counters for customers, accepting potion orders at the end of the day and sell her potions on the street. As Parfait gains more experience via studying in the library or creating potions, her levels will rise (with a maximum of six stars) which enables her to succeed more on potions that are high-leveled. Many places may trigger the encounter with other important characters whose futures the player must decide by motivating Parfait.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Kuroneko-san Team"],"publishers":["Kogado Studio"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":925257600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2z5c.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":216185,"name":"Little Horror Raiser","summary":"Choose a little horror to raise then unleash it upon the world.","genres":["Simulator","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co68me.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":188099,"name":"Little Mouse's Encyclopedia + Under Leaves","summary":"Little Mouse's Encyclopedia is ideal for born explorers.

In a platformer/adventure hybrid she has to explore woods and caves, learn new spells and solve the problems of numerous people and magical creatures on her way. The game's mechanics and progression are similar to some of the Wonder Boy episodes, with slightly more emphasis on \"RPG elements\". It is also text heavy for this kind of game, and pages over pages on a special story book screen are no rarity.\n\nThe game world is divided into seperate areas, but some of the dungeons are huge and map-drawing is almost obligatory. Most of the witch's spells are used to fight the many imaginative enemies, but \"talk\" is a spell too, which results in frequent inconvenient switching in the menu. Without some serious grinding, most enemies are capable to kill the witch fast, resulting in many frustrating game over screens, but at least it is possible to save the game at any time. Yet the function should be handled with care, because it is also possible to save in unwinnable situations.\n\nLittle Witch has enough inspiration and fun ideas to be a very entertaining little game (it even uses pictures as doors to jump through between areas, two years before Super Mario 64), however done by a bunch of university students, the technical execution leaves much to be desired. There's hardly ever been choppier scrolling in a retail game and everything flickers like crazy, making enemies much harder than they need to be and not seldom rendering the game almost unplayable. The potential for a great game was there, and the graphics look really nice (if amateurish), but it would have needed a bit more programming expertise to truly shine.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xke.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":152860,"name":"Life In Planet","summary":"Build, arrive, and move into new regions and planets in the depths of space.

As Parfait gains more experience via studying in the library or creating potions, her levels will rise (with a maximum of six stars) which enables her to succeed more on potions that are high-leveled.

Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.\n\nTarget Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.\n\nDefender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.\n\nRanger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.\n\nThe Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Nintendo EAD Software Development Group No.3"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":60.0,"release_date":1195430400,"platforms":["Wii"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ocw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":127537,"name":"Liu Jie Mi Ti","summary":"失意青年刘在机缘巧合下得到了一份离奇的工作，在命运齿轮的推动下，结识了几名性格各异的少女。忽然有一天祸从天降，他卷入了一起绑架案，并被迫参与一场事关生死的游戏。在求生的同时，他不得不重新审视过去生活寻求蛛丝马迹，那看似平静的生活实则早已暗流涌动……","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1587600000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5iza.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":88528,"name":"Lightbot: Programming Puzzles","summary":"Featured by Apple in over 100 countries\n*Best New Apps and Games*\n*Best for Learning to Code*\n*Best in Hot Educational Games*\n\nGet kids hooked on coding within minutes! \n\nLightbot is a programming puzzle game- a game whose game mechanics require using programming logic to solve levels. \n\nSimply guiding a robot to light up tiles and solve levels using commands, Lightbot cultivates a real understanding of procedures, loops, and conditionals.\n\nEducators around the world are choosing to use Lightbot first when introducing their students to programming, coding and Computer Science. \n\nLightbot features 50 levels and 20 challenge stars to collect and is a must-have for puzzle enthusiasts.\n\nThis version of Lightbot can be played in English, French, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Norwegian, Slovenian, Romanian, Indonesian, German, Polish, Danish, Croatian, Dutch, Slovak, Czech, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Thai, Hindi, Swedish, Finnish and Hungarian!

Each player (2 to 6, computer or human) has an army of particles and a cursor. The objective of the game is to assimilate all enemy particles. The players can only move their cursors and cannot directly control the particles. Each particle follows the shortest path around the obstacles to its team's cursor. A player may have several thousands particles at a time, giving the collection of particles a look of a liquid blob. When a particle moves into a particle from a different team, it will fight and if the opponent particle fails to fight back (it is not moving in the opposite direction) it will eventually be assimilated by its attacker. As particles cannot die but only change teams, the total number of particles on the map remains constant. Since a particle can only fight in one direction at a time (towards its team's cursor), a player that surrounds its opponents will have a distinct advantage. The game ends when one player controls all of the particles or when the time runs out. When the time runs out, the player with the most particles wins.\n\nThere are multiple maps which affect the obstacles in the battlefield. These obstacles may affect the strategies of the game.\n\nLiquid War is a multiplayer game and can be played by up to 6 people on one computer, or over the Internet or a LAN. A single player mode is available in which the opponents are controlled by the computer. The computer AI's \"strategy\" is to constantly choose a random point in the enemy and move its cursor to it.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1192579200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4kb4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":233910,"name":"LightEaters!","summary":"The LightEaters are coming… because darkness is never safe!

Obviously not a WAD for everyone, the core target for such a mod is mainly people who are in video game glitches, corruptions and to some extent, creepypastas (whether that love is ironic or not). Nothing works as it is supposed to. You can hardly understand most of the things that are happening to you. Some of the custom monsters (like the hitscanning corrupted pinky) will put you on edge and keep you paranoid about the ruleset of the game.\n\nThe aesthetic of lilith.pk3 is one of a kind, horribly mangling the rendering engine of old ZDoom beyond belief to disform sprites, textures, text and even sound effects. The end result makes close to no sense, your Doom marine sprite is heavily dislocated and looks more like one of those creatures from Alien than a human being and the list goes on and on. The confused looks obviously doesn't always make for clean or concise gameplay, especially in later levels which crank the confusion up to eleven and manipulate the level geometry to do things you thought weren't possible in the game. Even basic things like crushers, slime pits or a turnstile look horribly out of shape and makes the player uncomfortable.\n\nThis is essentially what lilith boils down to: an unfamilarity to something we thought we knew by heart, a rising sense of uncomfort as the level design makes less and less sense and offering the player a new perspective on what Doom is. Don't play lilith expecting top-notch Doom gameplay, but play it for the one of a kind experience it offers you.

The helicopter fires thinner and weaker shots, but turns in the direction it moves (similar to the later Zero Gunner), giving it great range; powerups increase the strength of shots, as well as the number of bullets per shot (adding a small \"spread\" effect to the shot while moving around).\nBoth the fighter and the helicopter also start with three bombs which wipe out everything in their path, including enemy shots. These bombs are also unique compared to similar games, in that they produce a line of small horizontal blasts that can be \"directed\" at the line travels across the ground, by pressing left and right (similar to the helicopter's shots).

There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself. As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Pack-In-Video"],"publishers":["Artdink"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":812332800,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2kr2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":14232,"name":"Air Warrior","summary":"The most advanced, realistic air combat simulator available.\n\nYou've gotta be good to fly against these guys... or be ready to take the flak.\n\n\"262s-low!\" Assassin radioed.\n\nGreat!

It was originally a text-based game written in BASIC and has since been ported to various programming languages and platforms including graphical versions.\n\nThe original text-based version of Hunt the Wumpus uses a command line text interface. A player of the game enters commands to move through the rooms or to shoot \"crooked arrows\" along a tunnel into one of the adjoining rooms. There are twenty rooms, each connecting to three others, arranged like the vertices of a dodecahedron or the faces of an icosahedron (which are identical in layout). Hazards include bottomless pits, super bats (which drop the player in a random location, a feature duplicated in later, commercially published adventure games, such as Zork I, Valley of the Minotaur, and Adventure), and the Wumpus itself. The Wumpus is described as having sucker feet (to escape the bottomless pits) and being too heavy for a super bat to lift. When the player has deduced from hints which chamber the Wumpus is in without entering the chamber, he fires an arrow into the Wumpus's chamber to kill it. The player wins the game if he kills the Wumpus. However, firing the arrow into the wrong chamber startles the Wumpus, which may cause it to move to an adjacent room. The player loses if he or she is in the same room as the Wumpus (which then eats him or her) or a bottomless pit.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Gregory Yob","Kevin Kenney"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":102384000,"platforms":["Microcomputer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8c7p.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"12599","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hunt the Wumpus"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"13729","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-13729/"}]},{"igdb_id":11680,"name":"H.U.R.L.","summary":"H.U.R.L. is a nonviolent video game aimed at children that was released in 1995 by a publishing house called Deep River Publishing. It is a first-person shooter (FPS), and is part of the wave of nonviolent FPSes that followed closely on the release of Doom and other games such as Wolfenstein 3D in the early 90s. It was later re-released as Slob Zone 3D, and then translated to German and released as Blob Schlammschlacht 3D (\"Blob Mudfight 3D\").\n\nThe game takes place in an area called The Slob Zone which is under the control of Bob the Slob, who controls the Hardcore Union of Radical Litterbugs, a legion of oversized creatures such as frogs and cats who give the game its name. The game provides a storyline stating that Bob the Slob has stolen the world's supply of clean underwear and it is up to the player to get it back. The player finds himself navigating through various neighborhoods from which the human population seems to have been chased out, and which are now occupied by the aforementioned sloppy animals, most of whom are armed with trash and ready to dump it on any player attempting to break in and clean up. The hero's role involves not only staying clean while navigating through the game's ten increasingly messy levels, but also cleaning up after the animals, who have dirtied the landscape with waste items such as banana peels, empty soda bottles, and apple cores. As the player gathers up this rubbish, he will be on the lookout for vending machines where it can be dropped off and traded for weapons: soap, water balloons, and deodorant, which he can use to fight back against the animals as they hurl their trash at him. If an animal is hit too many times, it will stop attacking and usually allow the player to pass. If the player is hit too many times, the screen displays the message \"YOU'VE BEEN SLOBBED!\" and the level starts over again with all the trash and animals respawned, and no weapons or trash in the hands of the player. However, the game can be saved at any point, and restoring a saved game will also restore the weapons and money the player had when it was saved.\n\nLacking violence, the game uses graphical surrealism and potty humor to keep its young audience interested. The player must search each level for bathrooms in the hopes of finding a clean toilet to use to clean himself up after being hit in the face with dirty things such as kitty litter. In the final level the player sneaks into a nightclub and then into a house with no bathroom, and meets the game's only boss, whose weapon of choice is his own dirty diapers and who emits a brief fart-like sound when hit. In order that the game be able to earn an RSAC rating suitable for children, no graphic depictions of anything obscene are included.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the enemies has been criticized for being of sub-standard quality. Some animals disobey the apparent rules of surrender in that they will not let the player pass by even after being defeated (this is sometimes known as solid corpses in more violent games), and one game reviewer noted his frustration with being unable to complete a level simply because an animal was blocking his passage through a door.","genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"developers":["Millennium Media Group"],"publishers":["Deep River Publishing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820368000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9rkh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11760,"name":"Hugo: På Nye Eventyr","summary":"There are several Hugo video games based on early episodes of Interactive Television Entertainment's TV show Hugo, part of the international Hugo franchise.

Instead, you navigate sites in, around and under Paris, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to solve puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to lose a life at the merest contact.\n\nThe narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along the way in the transition from high literature to action arcade game and back to crypto-literary interactive fiction, but they take what they've learned about design along the way and present things clearly, possessions and companions continually visually indicated above a baroque text input/output field. The interface is as intuitive as those of the prior games in the franchise, despite the enormous gulf between their respective styles of gameplay.

As the player, you have no defense... however, you must show empathy and courage to save the twelve missing orphans. This is a game for people who like to explore, listen, think and solve - and play cat and mouse in a dark and scary maze. Listen to the nineteen personal creepypasta-style stories to piece together the mysterious events of that fateful night in 1898, when twelve orphans simply... disappeared! Now with shorter (30-60 sec) in-game stories to enhance the tension and new plot twists when you least expect them! And don’t panic story lovers! The full stories are still there – on the menu page and somewhere within the game… if you know where to look!! \n \nFind the twelve orphan’s mementos and place them on the correct headstones to set the lost souls free. Did we mention the headstones are in a hedge maze? Custom-created by a ‘Ripley’s Believe-It-Or-Not’ Maze Master? No problem! But first you’ll have to find the key... Are you up to the challenge? Did we mention the Huntsman… in the maze… stalking you? Did we mention he may also be lurking in Grimhaven Orphanage? \n \nSo – how fast can you turn and run?

He waged war against two other powerful monarchs, Yandi and Chiyou, fighting for control over China. After a long time, the power of Yandi was reduced, and Chiyou disappeared, allowing Huangdi to become the emperor. But the war was not over. For centuries and millennia later it continued, taking different shapes - blood, battles and ambitions of warlocks would not end. In the Three Kingdoms era, 3rd century AD, the ancient war was revived once again. And so the seventeen-year-old boy Ji Xuan, proficient in sword fighting, and his older sister Ji Shuang, a master of demon-summoning, found themselves involved in a great conflict that will soon change their lives forever...\n\n\"Huanxiang Sanguozhi\", meaning Fantasy Story of Three Kingdoms, is based on historical events, featuring famous characters from the Three Kingdoms epoch, which became so popular in Asia thanks to Luo Guanzhong's classic novel. But the game gives a different interpretation to the story, involving fictional and supernatural characters and themes that were absent in other adaptations of the saga. The game plays like a traditional Asian RPG. You can set your combat style to be entirely turn-based, or with active time element, like in Final Fantasy games. The battles are viewed from isometric perspective, while navigation through the game world is done from a regular third person view. The enemies are visible in hostile areas, but appear randomly on the world map. The game allows you to choose between three difficulty levels.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["UserJoy Entertainment"],"publishers":["Nihon Falcom","Unistar"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1056412800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5nrx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"14602","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Huanxiang Sanguozhi"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"15932","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15932/"}]},{"igdb_id":70105,"name":"Hunchback at the Olympics","summary":"Summer Games clone.","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["Century Electronics"],"publishers":["Magic Electronics","Software Projects Ltd"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["Arcade","Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sswtyrco6ko1gnnyexjp.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"16581","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-16581/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"15196","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hunchback%20at%20the%20Olympics"}]},{"igdb_id":70226,"name":"Huggly Saves the Turtles: Thinking Adventures","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kpr6cbtj9mmrgeozdft2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":70679,"name":"Hula Wii: Minna de Fura Oodorou!","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"24303","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-24303/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"22014","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hula%20Wii%3A%20Minna%20de%20Fura%20Oodorou"}]},{"igdb_id":70736,"name":"Humpty Dumpty meets the Fuzzy Wuzzies","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":70817,"name":"Hunter Story","summary":"《Hunter Story》is a horizontal action game which Use 2D cartoon style.

The game has been remastered for C64 cartridge and boasts a host of amazing new features including over 50 new levels, 5 new star systems, new level types, new music, new playing modes, stunning intro and outro sequences, built-in level editor, and enhanced presentation including foreign language support.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1532995200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4r6l.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"734544650","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hunter's%20Moon%20Remastered"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"279704","url":"https://thalamusdigital.itch.io/hunters-moon-remastered"}]},{"igdb_id":135561,"name":"Hugo: The Magic Journey","summary":"During this magical journey, Trak and Geo visit more than 20 countries.

Some backgrounds appear as they should have elements of interactively, however, were not used in the release of the game. These include scenes where the player is going through an asteroid field and asteroids fly towards the player. Another scene is in the crystal caverns, where there are many obstacles which could have been made to be avoided. These are only two of many scenes which could have had interactive elements. The game may have been decided to have been too hard to play with these background obstacles and computer fighters to play. Hence removing the background interactively to make the game more playable. The game starts with the player in Frald Rancer's home city, then taking off into outer space via a fly-by of the city. The backgrounds are very Sci-Fi and are fantasy themed. They are very interesting, more so than the game.

Hanson and published by Mindscape for the Commodore 64. The game is based on the Indiana Jones series, and was released in North America around January 1985, while a U.K. version was released in March 1985.\n\nGameplay requires the player to think like fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones to solve the puzzles of each level, as the game does not provide the player with any rules or gameplay information; the game's cover advertised, \"Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you.\"\n\nIndiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom features six levels played across a \"Lost Kingdom.\" Playing as Indiana Jones, the player must solve a puzzle in each level to progress through the game. The player's ultimate goal is to retrieve a valuable artifact that contains the secrets of a lost civilization, before Jones' arch-rival, Ivar Reiss, can take it for himself. Indiana Jones is armed only with a mystical cane, and must battle against numerous enemies and perils throughout the game, including bats, monsters, steep cliffs, twisting mazes, and \"killer snowflakes\". Joystick movements vary between each level, requiring the player to relearn the control scheme throughout the game. A two-player option is also available.\n\nNo rules or gameplay information is provided to the player, who is left to use logic and intuition to solve each puzzle, as Indiana Jones would. Solving each puzzle requires the player to pay close attention to subtle changes in each level's surroundings or musical score, as well as other possibilities, testing the player's \"Indiana Jones Quotient\" (IJQ). However, the game's instruction manual does feature clues at the bottom of each page. Each clue is presented as a hieroglyphic, and must be deciphered by the player using a magic viewer, similar to 3D glasses. A \"clue hotline\" was also available for players, providing them with pre-recorded hints on how to finish each level.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Mindscape, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co97rh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":7342,"name":"Inside","summary":"An atmospheric 2D side-scroller in which, hunted and alone, a boy finds himself drawn into the center of a dark project and struggles to preserve his identity.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Playdead"],"publishers":["Playdead"],"aggregated_rating":92.48717948717949,"release_date":1467158400,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fca.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":375611,"name":"Infinity Nikki: Encore Season","summary":"The \"Unleash Your Style: Super Styling Contest\" has officially kicked off in Wishfield!\nStep into the competition and showcase your one-of-a-kind style and boundless creativity on the grand stage!\nWith three groups vying for the championship, how many trials and challenges will you face on your way to the top?\n\nAs the candlestick lights the way to the past and old friends reunite, it's not sorrow we feel—but the warmth of shared memories.\nRemember, every encounter is a miracle!","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":["Papergames"],"publishers":["InFold"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1761523200,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coarnn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":329026,"name":"Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings","summary":"The plot centers around Indy's search for the Staff of Moses.

All of these modes are also available in multiplayer, with up to eight players participating simultaneously. \n \nMore than one hundred and fifty races combined into championships and cup competitions take place in Europe, America, Africa and the Antarctic. The game has an enormous variety of long distance tracks: sand and snowy deserts, high-speed roads and impassable cross-country paths, African beaches and deserted Antarctic stations. \n \nThe game features 18 vehicles of different classes, from buggies to monstrous “Bigfoots”, as well as an additional prototype class. Rating points won in the races can be used to upgrade any of the vehicles, from a selection of 15 running gear, body or engine upgrade alternatives. Each vehicle is furnished with a detailed destruction system. Reaching the end of a course without suffering any losses is an enormous challenge that only a select few are able to accomplish. The opponents, who constantly create extreme situations, aren’t the only danger: players also need to watch out for railway crossings, heavy tanker trucks and even lightning in stormy weather.","genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"developers":["Game Factory Interactive"],"publishers":["Targem Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1327363200,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tcnkvlolvm8gckujpqdq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":37374,"name":"Inuyasha: Fuuun Emaki","summary":"Inuyasha: Fuuun Emaki is an Adventure game, developed and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2002.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Bandai"],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1030406400,"platforms":["WonderSwan Color"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co79pv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":344525,"name":"In a Bit of Tales","summary":"In a Bit of Tales is a unique horror anthology game featuring seven spine-chilling stories delivered in an omakase-style experience.

It was written by Patricia Fogleman and Michael Berlyn and was the first in the \"Tales of Adventure\" line. Due to Infocom's virtual Z-Machine, it was ported to a wide variety of popular computing systems of the day, including the Apple II and Commodore 64. It is Infocom's tenth game.\n\nIn 1916, Dr. Ellington came into possession of a 5000-year-old fragment of pottery covered with hieroglyphics. (Conveniently for the text-only game, these runes look strangely like ASCII characters.) After years of painstaking research, Ellington managed to decipher a portion of the text, which indicated the general location of a pyramid that no one had heard of before. He managed to organize a modest expedition to the area in 1920, but found nothing before he died except a small block of limestone bearing the same style of hieroglyphics. According to the partial translation he made, the new fragment spoke of a queen and great riches. When Howard Carter discovered King Tut's tomb a few years later, Dr. Ellington's widow figured that someone had found the pyramid her husband had been looking for. She stowed the papers and artifacts away and forgot all about them. Rose found them in the early 1980s after her mother's death and did some preliminary fact-checking. The pyramid indicated by her father's papers is nowhere near Tut's. In fact, no pyramids have ever been discovered in the area Dr. Ellington was investigating. Rose is by no means a rich woman—she only wants someone to give her father the recognition he deserves—so it'll be a modest expedition. But it sure sounds like the perfect chance for an opportunistic soldier-of-fortune to make a name for himself.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Infocom"],"publishers":["Infocom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":441676800,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit","Commodore C64/128/MAX","TRS-80 Color Computer","Atari ST/STE","Mac","DOS","Amiga","Apple II","TRS-80","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co211g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":247151,"name":"Intervallic","summary":"In this 2D sidescrolling rhythm game use your MIDI instrument or computer keyboard to guide a robot alien cat through space!","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1696550400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6f65.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":125552,"name":"InfantryWar","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":265573,"name":"Infinite Country","summary":"Weird Q-bomb RPG, bloody and realistic and realistic, Built-in homemade drama editor, 2D horizontal backroom stage play...","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1695081600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co71ox.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":310322,"name":"Innerscape","summary":"Play as Dr. Alan Miles, a parasite investigator, in a survival horror quest inside a critically ill alien.

Initially, only Kagome and her half-demon companion Inuyasha are playable, but as players journey through the game, acquiring shards, more characters become available.\n\nEach character is able to perform both strong and weak attacks, as well as throws and counter attacks. Players can also execute more powerful combination maneuvers, including special and super attacks, which can only be initiated when the Spiritual meter is filled.

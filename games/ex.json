The game's core gameplay revolves around precise shooting, strategic grenade use, and skillful maneuvering to overcome a relentless array of enemies and environmental hazards. Known for its high difficulty level, Exolon challenges players with fast-paced action that demands quick reflexes and careful planning.\n\nWhat sets Exolon apart is its distinctive visual style, which pushed the graphical boundaries of 8-bit computers in its era. The game features detailed sprites and backgrounds that create a unique sci-fi atmosphere, complemented by a pulsing soundtrack that enhances the immersive experience. This combination of challenging gameplay, striking visuals, and atmospheric audio helped Exolon stand out in the late 1980s gaming landscape, earning it a cult following among retro gaming enthusiasts. Despite its simple premise, the game's intense action and memorable presentation have secured its place as a notable title in the history of side-scrolling shooters.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Hewson Consultants"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co93ix.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":311809,"name":"Explosive Shooting Star Beetle","summary":"\"Explosive Shooting Star Beetle\" is an exhilarating bullet-hell shooter where you aim for explosive cherry chains.

The power can be refilled, and the ship itself upgraded, through collecting the power-ups that appear after destroying certain enemies. \n \nThe game can be played by up to two players in alternating turns. Similar as in Gorf, it features several different types of waves (stages). For instance, one stage features space witches saddle-perched on either serpentlike Chinese dragons or Western-style winged dragons: the dragons must to be hit repeatedly in the weak point of their heads to be killed, after which the riders themselves can be shot for a score bonus. The player progresses through most of them by either destroying all the enemies (resulting in the score bonus and power-up awards) or alternatively just surviving their attacks for a long enough time. \n \nThe game was mostly well received by Western game critics, albeit some criticized it for its depiction of women.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":163812,"name":"EXA: The Infinite Instrument","summary":"Step into EXA, an immersive musical studio where you can compose, record, and perform music using expressive instruments of your own design.

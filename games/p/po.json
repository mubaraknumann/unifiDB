The Red Ranger can move through objects, the Yellow Ranger can create duplicates of herself, the Green Ranger can see heat trails, the Blue Ranger can create a force field, and the Pink Ranger can replicate objects she touches. There's also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters.

It was initially released for the PC-9821 computer platform in 1994, followed by remade versions for the 3DO in 1995, and the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, despite plans for an English localization of the Saturn version. On August 24, 2009 (in honor of the 46th birthday of the game designer, Hideo Kojima), an unofficial English translation patch was released onto the internet.\n\nThe game is set in a primarily first person perspective and uses a point-and-click interface: the player can move the cursor and have the protagonist (Jonathan Ingram) analyze objects around his environment or talk to other characters in the game. Like in Snatcher, the game features shooting segments where the player must defend their character from incoming enemies. The player can use the shooting trainer at the police department to test their reflex and accuracy. There are numerous puzzles in the game, including an event where the player must dismantle a bomb by following their partner's instructions.\n\nThe console versions of the game all include support for their respective mouse peripherals. The Saturn version features light gun support for the shooting segments.\n\nThe game was notable for being an early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a theme revolving around space exploration and occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to Snatcher, but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. Policenauts also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player's memory of the plot upon reloading a save, an element Kojima would later use in Metal Gear Solid. The PlayStation version of Policenauts could also read the memory card and give some easter egg dialogues if a save file of Konami's dating sim Tokimeki Memorial is present, a technique Kojima would also later use in Metal Gear Solid.","genres":["Shooter","Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Konami"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":775440000,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","PlayStation 3","3DO Interactive Multiplayer","Sega Saturn","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co720g.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"15090","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-15090/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"13844","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Policenauts"}]},{"igdb_id":4327,"name":"PO'ed","summary":"PO'ed is a first-person shooter with two simple objectives: escape the alien homeworld and kick lots of butt!

The PC version of the game was released November 30, 1998 and a PlayStation version was later developed and released on April 2, 1999.\n\nUnlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player in the role of a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.\n\nPopulous: The Beginning was the first entry in the series to use true 3D computer graphics; Bullfrog waited four years after Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods so that the graphics technology could catch up to their vision for a new and different game in the series. The developers considered the addition of terrain deformation and manipulation, combined with \"smart\" villagers who automatically attended to tasks, to add an entirely new dimension to the series. The game's original title was Populous: The Third Coming before being changed prior to the beta release.\nPopulous: The Beginning plays very differently from earlier titles and received mixed reviews. Reviewers positively noted the excellent graphics, while complaints were directed at the artificial intelligence and the indecision in game design between being a real time strategy title and a god game. GamePro's Peter Olafson wrote that Populous: The Beginning was not a bad game, in fact a good one; \"but it's a different game—one without a quintessential quality that defined Populous.\"","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Bullfrog Productions"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts","Dice Multi Media Europe","Sold Out Sales & Marketing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":912384000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25er.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":5630,"name":"Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor","summary":"The game is a dungeon crawl, with focus on hack and slash combat and exploration of large dungeons.

Power Stone 2 allows up to four players to choose from multiple characters and utilize items such as tables, chairs, and rocks in battle.\n\nThere are four different modes available for the game\n\n1-on-1: Much like the original Power Stone, a two-character storyline game.\nArcade: A four-character storyline game, with two characters advancing each round.\nOriginal: Multiplayer mode, with free choice of characters and stages.\nAdventure: An unpredictable storyline game, where players can collect items, cards and money.\nPower Stone 2 offers five interactive 3-D stages to begin with, plus the two boss stages which players can also access in Original mode. All but the Original mode is played out like a storyline, where two battles are fought on the regular stages, followed by the Pharaoh Walker boss, then another battle, and ending with the Dr. Erode boss stage. Three extra stages may be unlocked for Original mode by meeting certain requirements in Arcade mode, as well as a desert area stage, which is essentially the Pharaoh Walker boss stage, but without the boss. Though each player has their own set of default ground and air attacks, the character can execute more powerful fusion attacks after collecting three Power Stones and transforming. Power Stone 2 does not offer an opportunity to block, although tapping on the control pad just before an enemy attacks will cause you to dodge.\n\nMost of the stages are dynamic and will change as the battle progresses. For example, the airplane stage starts out on a warplane. After a set amount of time, the plane will fall apart, forcing all the players to battle while skydiving toward the ground. Shortly after, the players will fall onto a floating platform, where the remainder of the battle will be held. This, in essence, creates three sub-stages within a single one.\n\nEach stage is also littered with item boxes, which hold a random item that a player has acquired and unlocked in Adventure mode or created in the Item Shop. They may also contain Power Stones. Items are extremely diverse. Damaging items range from guns, flamethrowers, gigantic hammers, a wide assortment of swords, to bear traps, roller blades, and even a magazine that can be thrown. Non-damaging items include food that will replenish health, shields for defense, elixirs for invisibility, adhesive sprays to slow your opponents, and wings for extra jumps. Cards that can be used to mix items can also be found in Adventure mode. Furthermore, most stages also have their own collection of unique items and fixtures that the player can use. For example, the submarine level comes with turrets, small planes to drop bombs, and icebergs to throw at opponents. Each level is also highly interactive, as players can use many of the stage elements themselves. All players can also gain extra height by jumping off a wall.","genres":["Fighting","Platform"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Eidos Interactive Europe","Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":956793600,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation Portable","Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8izi.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3397","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Power Stone 2"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3712","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-3712/"}]},{"igdb_id":13107,"name":"Power Stone Collection","summary":"Capcom ported the entire Power Stone series to the PlayStation Portable with a few enhancements: most notably, the PSP version of the original Power Stone included the four new characters introduced in Power Stone 2.","genres":["Fighting","Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":1161302400,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gtn.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"18011","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18011/"}]},{"igdb_id":13884,"name":"Poppy Kart","summary":"Poppy kart is a funny karting game in a pixelated world.

Trainers that win the Tournament get a huge prize as well as world wide renown.\n\nYou, a 13-year-old kid from Moki Town, did not set out to become a Pokemon Master. After your mother Lucille died ten years ago in an accident at a nuclear power plant, your father Kellyn, the top Pokemon Ranger in the Tandor Ranger Union, left you with your elderly aunt and departed to travel the region.

You step up to the challenge, along with your rival, a younger boy named Theo.

Once See the videoyou’ve baked the snake, you land your sled on the surface and have a shootout with Gryptogg, Raygoth and Arkus.

When you escape from their maze, you advance to the next level and begin the fight anew. (North American Philips / Probe 2000, 1983 – unreleased)\n\nThis Colecovision adaptation of the Odyssey2 game (now there’s a phrase you’re never going to see again), based on a less-than-blockbuster-successful series of comics and action figures, adds more depth to the game than the dear old Odyssey ever could’ve managed. But it’s hard to tell how much depth, as the game was never completed.\n\nThe “snake” screen, though it’s much more impressive visually than its counterpart on the Odyssey2, is just plain boring. The O2 edition of Power Lords also forced you to dodge earthbound meteors and an “artificial black hole” within the volcano that could drag you to your doom if you got on a horizontal line of sight with it when it opened. On the Colecovision, all you have to contend with are enemy vehicles and a slow-moving snake. It takes more time than effort to clear this screen, and it’s ultimately a bit boring.\n\nThe other screens, which aren’t even hinted at in the Odyssey2 version of the game, are also a bit tedious – enemy A.I. and combat programming obviously weren’t finished when the game was abandoned. You can exchange fire with your interestingly-animated opponents, but sometimes they just stop firing and disappear. Convenient, sure, but not terribly exciting.\n\n“Probe 2000” was an imprint – akin to Atari’s “Atarisoft” division – opened by North American Philips to release games for hardware other than the Odyssey2, which was by now firmly into its twilight. The only game actually released by Probe 2000 was War Room, programmed by Bob “RoSHa” Harris (who created Killer Bees on the O2). Probe 2000’s next release would’ve been either Power Lords or the impressive RPG Lord Of The Dungeon (which was left in limbo because its battery-backed-up cartridge, capable of saving the player’s position, was an idea that just wouldn’t be practical until the NES era). The intellectual property rights to Pink Panther had been snagged by N.A.P. for the Odyssey2 and other systems, but the only version of that game that has ever surfaced has been an incredibly rare Atari 2600 prototype. N.A.P. ultimately got out of the game business, leaving both the Odyssey2 and Probe 2000 behind.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp."],"publishers":["North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":412905600,"platforms":["ColecoVision"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mot.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":40988,"name":"Point Blank 2","summary":"Point Blank 2 is the sequel to the now classic arcade game Point Blank, which was converted to the PlayStation in 1998.

Based around a video game within a video game concept, players take control of a character who is in turn playing on a virtual reality simulator assuming the role of Redd Ace, which is recreating his battle against the Sinlendo Techmods by recovering necessary bomb components to defeat the alien race at the Ceegraian Power Station. Its gameplay consists of platforming, exploration and weapons-based combat with a main four-button configuration.\n\nPower Factor originally began as a project intended for the Atari ST that was in development by Red Rat Software under the title Red Ace, which was nearly completed before being left unpublished due to internal issues at the company and its eventual disbandment prior to release, however Hand Made Software would later develop a conversion to the Lynx.\n\nPower Factor has been met with positive reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release, who praised various aspects of the title such as the unique storyline, graphics and character animation but many felt divided in regards to the sound design and gameplay. In 2005, a ROM image of the original ST version was leaked online.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Hand Made Software"],"publishers":["Atari Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":728524800,"platforms":["Atari Lynx"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1uby.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"45163","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-45163/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"459277","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Power%20Factor"}]},{"igdb_id":62337,"name":"Popo Team","summary":"Popo Team is a game in which various animals use a machine known as the \"Chi Chi Po\" to clean garbage across the Earth.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Sachen"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b6zc79iivcyforojx1az.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"459210","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Popo%20Team"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"45096","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-45096/"}]},{"igdb_id":62883,"name":"Pocket Trains","summary":"The latest game from the developers of Nimble Quest, Tiny Tower, and Pocket Planes.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["NimbleBit"],"publishers":["NimbleBit"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1380153600,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7qmj.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"370544","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pocket%20Trains"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"43888","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-43888/"}]},{"igdb_id":62942,"name":"Pom Gets Wi-Fi","summary":"Made on RPGMaker 2003 with the intention of being the happiest, least scary game ever made on that engine.\n\nFeaturing:\n\n* 2 endings!\n* Over 20 dog breeds!\n* 100 billion lines of dialogue","genres":[],"developers":["Brianna Lei"],"publishers":["Brianna Lei"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1388448000,"platforms":["Web browser","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3vpe.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"143943","url":"https://brianna-lei.itch.io/pom-gets-wi-fi"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"43698","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-43698/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"370339","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pom Gets Wi-Fi"}]},{"igdb_id":63015,"name":"PoPoLoCrois Monogatari","summary":"The first entry in the PoPoLoCrois franchise, a series of tactical RPGs published by Sony.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["G-Artists"],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":837129600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Super NES CD-ROM System","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gok.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"313430","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/PoPoLoCrois Monogatari"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"43519","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-43519/"}]},{"igdb_id":63016,"name":"PoPoLoCrois Monogatari II","summary":"The direct sequel to 1996's PoPoLoCrois Monogatari. Picking up two years after the events of the first game, the game sees series protagonist Prince Pietro tasked with retrieving a crown from a nearby cave as part of his rite of succession. But after finding the crown, he encounters a mysterious figure. Identifying himself as Baskal, the figure delivers a strange prophecy to Pietro, and asks the prince a question.\n\n\"What do you think the true treasure of kings is?\"\n\nWith this question begins a touching, romantic, and sometimes tragic journey that will reunite Pietro with familiar faces, introduce him to new companions, and forever change the boy prince of the Kingdom of PoPoLoCrois.\n\nA much beloved sequel that many fans remember as the high point of the series, PoPoLoCrois Monogatari II builds on the already beautiful pixel art graphics of the first game, with detailed, lovingly crafted environments and some outstanding sprite animation. Spread across three discs, the game also features full voice acting for its story sequences, which was a series first, and a relative rarity for RPGs of the era.\n\nThe battle system broadly resembles that of its prequel, with combat taking place directly within the game's environments, and movement and positioning playing a key role in battles. But certain features have been simplified and streamlined compared to the first game, and the level of difficulty is generally a lot lower.\n\nMany of the game's events were loosely adapted in the third chapter of the 2005 PSP title PoPoLoCrois. The opening segments also appear as part of the same title's second chapter.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Sugar and Rockets"],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":948931200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6877.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"313429","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/%E3%83%9D%E3%83%9D%E3%83%AD%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AD%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9%E7%89%A9%E8%AA%9EII"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"43520","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-43520/"}]},{"igdb_id":63048,"name":"Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation: Minna de Pico Pokémon Waiwai Battle!","summary":"Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation: Minna de Pico Pokémon Waiwai Battle! is an education video game based on the third generation of the Pokémon series.

What would be the size of each planet or star? And how would you place them in orbit? If you are interested in Astronomy and looking for a powerful yet easy to use 3D universe sandbox app to create and simulate a whole new galaxy with realistic physics and gravity rules, then you’ve come to the right place. Pocket Universe, the 3D gravity sandbox game, provides you the ultimate power to explore the infinite space and simulate your own space full of different planets, gas giants, and stars. \nIn this gravity simulator app, you get to customize literally any aspect of these particles to simulate and design your very own pocket universe sandbox. Once you are satisfied with your customized solar system (or any other combination of particles, planets, and stars), you get to easily add it to your collection, take a screenshot and share it with the world.\nPocket Universe comes with a clean and neat design and the 3D simulation is so smooth that you won’t feel any difficulties or lags when bombarding your planets, or applying any condition to them. And make sure not to take the realistic gravity lensing effect as granted when looking at a black hole. It’s just fascinating. \n\nIs Pocket Universe Easy to Use?\nIs this 3D universe sandbox with realistic physics simulation powerful enough to create and design different planets, gas giants and stars? The answer is a BIG yes! But are the simulation tools easy to use? The answer is even a BIGGER yes! The user interface is so friendly, that you’ll get used to it after going through the step-by-step tutorial and trying available tools for a few times. After that, you just need to use your imagination and be creative to form some unique pocket universes with gravity simulator based on physics rules. If you are going to redesign our lovely solar system in our galaxy, you’ll have access to all the planets (mars, moon, earth, mercury etc …) and you have the power to unlock new worlds by meeting the right conditions, colliding with the right objects, and altering mass and sea level while keeping the temperature stable. To smash stuff together and create new planets, make sure to crash the right ones together. \nTip: To raise the sea level, hit a planet with ice meteors, and use rock meteors to lower the sea level. \nPocket Universe 3D Sandbox Main Features at a Glance:\n•\tWonderful 3D graphics with smooth universe simulator\n•\tSuper user-friendly interface with easy to learn gameplay\n•\tStep-by-step and detailed tutorial\n•\tHuge variety of particles, procedural planets, gas giants and stars\n•\tUltimate customization options for your creations\n•\t3D Gravity simulator with realistic physics rules\n•\tCreate Solar System with the tiniest details \n•\tTake screenshots from your pocket universe and share it with family and friends\n•\tUnlock new achievements\n•\tInteractive journal to track your creations\n•\tSave and Load simulated universes\n•\tNO ADS and NO in-app purchase items\nSo, Pocket Universe offers everything you should expect from such 3D gravity and Universe Sandbox games and it even sets the bar to a higher level by offering smooth particle simulator, realistic physics rules, user-friendly interface, a wide range of different particles, planets and stars, and a lot more.\nNo matter you are serious in Astronomy stuff or you just want to have fun creating some beautiful infinite universes, we’ve got you covered. You just need to take your time, select from wide range of stunning particles, stars, and planets, specify their positions and how they should rotate, and last but not the least decide which planets should collide to destroy and create new worlds. \nDownload Pocket Universe and let us know about any bugs, feature requests or any other suggestions. Stay tuned for whole new features, including repulsive gravity, fully 3D physics on different orbital planes, the option to view from the surface of the world and expanding on the life aspect of the game.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1492128000,"platforms":["iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rcqk3cdgqg5hfzycnxbd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"1214937203","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-universe-3d-sandbox/id1214937203?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"752606075","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pocket%20Universe%20-%203D%20Sandbox"}]},{"igdb_id":89209,"name":"Porkerpillar","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lnirh0nnixzvjib7cmua.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":89264,"name":"Pottery Maker","summary":"Let us bring the world ceramics to you.

Similarly to Reborn, Pokémon Rejuvenation is not a ROM hack, but a standalone game made with RPG Maker.\n\nThe game takes place in the Aevium region, which was split into several islands after some catastrophic event in the past. The protagonist and their mother, Nancy, are headed there aboard the S.S. Oceana when it gets attacked by local villainous team Team Xen. With the ship destroyed and their mother captured, the protagonist is narrowly saved and escapes to East Gearen City — shaken, but ready to challenge the Pokémon League, take the fight to Team Xen, and hopefully, rescue their mother in the process.\n\nLike its inspiration, Pokémon Reborn, Pokémon Rejuvenation has a more mature story than mainline Pokémon games (albeit not as dark as Reborn's). It also features much more difficult encounters, with two difficulty levels available: Story and Classic. The game borrows Reborn's ideas of a field effect system, 18 Gym Leaders, and a level cap, but also replaces the traditional Elite 4 with an Elite 8 and grants new, unique moves to every gym leader. In addition, the game brings back Shadow Pokémon from Pokémon Colosseum and its sequel, now rebalanced, with Fairy-type Pokémon resisting their attacks.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Janichroma"],"publishers":["Reborn, Evolved"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1408147200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5stf.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"531410699","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pok%C3%A9mon%20Rejuvenation"}]},{"igdb_id":139377,"name":"Population: One","summary":"Fly anywhere, climb anything, build defenses...

Horse Racing (US) or horseracing (UK) is an equestrian sport that has been practiced for millennia. It is inextricably associated with gambling. The common sobriquet for Thoroughbred horse racing is The Sport of Kings.\n\nHorse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: \"flat\" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2008 generated a world-wide market worth around US$115 billion.\n\nJapan conducts more than 21,000 horse races a year in one of three types: flat racing, jump racing (races over hurdles), and Ban'ei Racing (also called Draft Racing).\n\nThere are a total of thirty racetracks in Japan. Ten of these tracks are known as \"central tracks\", where most of Japan's top races are conducted.

The games' model number are PG-74 for the Tabletop game and PG-92 for the Panorama game. PG in the model number stands for Popeye Game. The Panorama game took and came with two LR44 batteries, while the Tabletop version came with two C batteries. Nintendo manufactured 250,000 versions of both games in America and Europe. It's unknown how many were manufactured in Japan. The game is based on the lucrative Popeye franchise, and in it you control Popeye. Nintendo was known during that era to create games based off on the Popeye franchise.\n\nBrutus has kidnapped Olive, and as Popeye you have to knock him out and punch him into the ocean to save Olive. The directional pad controls Popeye left and right. When Brutus tries to punch your character, move Popeye right to make him avoid the punch, then counter with one of your own. If Brutus move Popeye to the very right hand part of the pier, Popeye can still stay on by moving the control pad right at just the right moments, then counter-attack to move Brutus back to the left. Once Popeye moves Brutus to the very left hand corner of the pier, he will have to attack him a certain amount of times (the exact amount depending on your score) before he punches him into the ocean. In Game B a swordfish will occasionally try and poke Popeye. If it succeeds, then Popeye will move back a bit.\n\nAfter Brutus gets out of the ocean for the third time, Olive, who's at the top tied up, will kick cans of spinach down to Popeye for him to eat. If done so successfully, Popeye will gain so much strength that he knocks Brutus all the way up to the hook at the upper left hand corner. Following that, Popeye goes up to where Olive Ollie is and saves her, thus ending the game. After the game ends, it starts over again. If Popeye misses the Spinach, then he'll have to knock Brutus back into the ocean before she'll be able to kick more spinach down towards him.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Nintendo"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":365817600,"platforms":["Game & Watch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3auy.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":145173,"name":"PoPoLoCrois: Hajimari no Bouken","summary":"PoPoLoCrois: Hajimari no Bouken is the prequel to PoPoLoCrois: Tsuki no Okite no Bouken.

The inhabitants are subjected to torture or injected with a substance, transforming them into servant mummies. Not even the mummy of King Ramses is spared. As world leaders' attempts to send armed forces fail, you are selected among a few of the world's best special forces to infiltrate Karnak and eliminate the invaders from within. However, the mission takes a dark turn when your helicopter is shot down, leaving you alone to navigate through the chaos, aiming to complete your mission and survive.\n\nIn contrast to later console adaptations, the game's 20 single-player levels are played consecutively. The player searches for keys and secret areas to progress to the next level, akin to other games of the time, such as DOOM. The game employs a single save slot for each playthrough and incorporates a checkpoint system, enabling players to resume from the latest checkpoint they have discovered.

It was also ported to the Game Boy Advance under the name Pokémon Gold Version.\n\nThis is a simple platformer, in which the player controls Pikachu. Compared to many other NES games, the controls are inverted, which means that jumping is done by pressing B, and pressing A while moving in a direction makes Pikachu run, and A on its' own clears every enemy on the screen. It's also possible to stomp on enemies, similarly to Super Mario Bros.. Pikachu can take three hits before losing a life, with the number of hits left represented by a Poké Ball counter on the top left corner of the screen. There are a total of four worlds (Velbt, Woods, Tableland, and Motte) which are split into three levels each, as well as a single-screen boss battle at the end of each. This game has a debug mode enabled by default, allowing the player free movement while paused and to skip to the next level by pressing Select. In some places, the player can fall partway into the ground, although this doesn't have any implications. The music also glitches slightly at certain points.\n\nThe background graphics are mostly ripped and slightly modified from Athena and Adventure Island II. Some of the enemies are also taken from various games, with some of them based on Pokémon. The sound engine was taken from Twin Bee, a game published and developed by Konami, and, while the game has a soundtrack of its' own, all the sound effects are still recognizably from Twin Bee - a setup similar to what Super Game and Gamtec used to have.

It was released in Japan on September 12, 2009 bundled with every copy of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and then later released with every localized copy of the games. The accessory has a Poké Ball design with a small monochrome LCD screen and three functioning buttons. The Pokéwalker supports infrared signals allowing players to interact within a short range with a game card of Pokémon HeartGold or SoulSilver while slotted in the Nintendo DS, or with another Pokéwalker.\n\nThe system records every time a step is taken, and the daily step count influences which wild Pokémon and items will appear. The player can transfer a Pokémon to the Pokéwalker from either HeartGold or SoulSilver, which gains experience for each step. Like the Pokémon Pikachu and Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, the Pokéwalker uses a currency known as \"Watts\" (shortened to w); every 20 steps will earn the player one watt. Players can also catch various Pokémon and obtain items on the device, then transfer them to the game. Alongside the Johto Safari Zone, the Pokéwalker allows for Pokémon normally unavailable until after the player has traveled to Kanto, such as Murkrow, to be available before defeating the Johto League.\n\nMuch as HeartGold and SoulSilver are remakes of the original Gold and Silver, the Pokéwalker could be considered to be somewhat of a remake of Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, which interacted in much the same way with the Generation II games. Unlike Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, however, Pikachu is not the only Pokémon that can be interacted with, and Pokémon can actually be transferred to and from the Pokéwalker at any given time.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator"],"developers":["Game Freak"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1252713600,"platforms":["Handheld Electronic LCD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6yas.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245422,"name":"Pokémon Advanced: Cyber Poké Ball 2","summary":"This is the second version of the Cyber Poké Ball, a simple RPG set in the Pokémon universe and contained within a handheld shaped like a Poké Ball.

Who gets to decide? And why does everyone follow so blindly? Welcome to the Telius region, only months removed from a bloody civil war sparked by the actions of the tyrannical King, Tobias II.

First unleashed in arcades in the mid-’90s, GUNBIRD helped define the studio’s signature style: fast, vertically scrolling action, razor-sharp bullet patterns, and a cast of eccentric characters brought to life with humor and personality. This collection lets you experience GUNBIRD in both its original Arcade form and its Saturn home release, alongside fan-favorite sequel GUNBIRD 2 (Arcade), preserving the intensity and charm that made PSIKYO a name synonymous with hardcore shoot-’em-ups.\n\nRounding out the package is a thoughtfully curated lineup of classic arcade and console titles, all playable on Polymega. Take to the skies with Exerion, Cybattler, Skyfox (Exerizer), and E.D.F., test your reflexes with the puzzle-shooter hybrid Gunbarich, and explore deeper sci-fi action in Second Earth: Gratia. The collection also bridges the arcade and console worlds with Earth Defense Force / Super E.D.F. and Operation: Logic Bomb (JP: Ikari no Yousai) for the SNES / Super Famicom.

Built around the street-fighting spirit that defined an era, this collection traces the series’ evolution from gritty urban brawls to more expressive, mechanics-driven combat, capturing Jaleco’s distinctive approach to arcade-style action across both home and coin-op releases. Fans of the beat ’em up genre will find plenty to enjoy throughout this collection, especially when played with a friend.\n\nThe collection is rounded out by Jaleco's NINJA KAZAN and Psikyo's DARAKU TENSHI: THE FALLEN ANGELS, the latter of which is a visually striking and unconventional fighting game whose influence extended well beyond its original release. Members of the Daraku Tenshi team were even rumored to have later gone on to work at SNK, with character designs and visual sensibilities that would echo in later KOF series games.","genres":[],"developers":["Jaleco"],"publishers":["Playmaji"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1769558400,"platforms":["Polymega"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cobdlc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":387537,"name":"Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket: Fantastical Parade","summary":"Fantastical Parade includes the debut of the elegant Mega Gardevoir ex.

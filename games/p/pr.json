As the story develops, more is revealed about Jen's past and her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as the nature of the demon worlds.\n\nIn Primal, the player can control either Jen or Scree as they navigate the realms of Oblivion. As the game progresses, newer demonic forms are obtained, which prove invaluable in solving various puzzles and combat.\n\nControl can be switched between Jen and Scree at any time in game. When in control of one, the other will be operated by AI, performing various functions depending on the situation. During play, the characters can interact with one another, performing actions such as asking questions, or siphoning energy.\n\nWhen in control of Jen, the player may transform into one of four demonic forms for various purposes, depending on the situation (provided the forms are unlocked). When in a demon form, Jen experiences a boost in attack, defense, speed, attack range and access to abilities unavailable in a human form. The tattoo on Jen's back also glows when in a demon form, corresponding to various forms.\n\nDefeating enemies involves weakening enemies to the point where their hit points reach zero, at which time a finishing move must be performed to kill the enemy. While the moves differ in style and time taken, the final effect remains the same. Enemies can be finished off before the health bar reaches zero, and doing so leaves more residual energy.\n\nWhile Jen can remain in a demonic form indefinitely, taking damage will reduce health. However, hit points here are represented by demonic energy. When an enemy is killed, the remaining energy can be drained through use of Scree, who can store the energy for when it is needed. Jen can then call on the energy, siphoning it off to replenish her own. Scree can store a vast amount of energy, but also has limits as to how much.\n\nWhen in control of Scree, the player is invulnerable; Scree, being a gargoyle, cannot suffer damage, making him an effective scout. Scree is capable of climbing on stone walls, a necessary ability when traversing the realms. Scree can also store drained energy from dead enemies, which can be used to replenish Jen's demonic health, though he must remain immobile when doing so.\n\nScree is revealed to be the long-lost Abdizur, who disappeared following an encounter with the lord of Chaos. In Solus, for a temporary amount of time, the player possesses a life-size statue of Abdizur via Scree, to combat Belhazur when Jen's powers are not fit to do so. The player may also possess other statues in an area under given circumstances.\n\nThe player may also happen across various energy crystals, which can be stored and used if Scree's energy reserves are not enough and the player is at low health. These crystals are kept throughout the game, the only exclusion being when revisiting previous scenes, at which point they are reduced to a default amount. This means that the crystals function as extra lives, to a degree.\n\nIf Jen is in human form, her health replenishes automatically if she is not in battle (human form only; demon energy must be replenished by either drawing on Scree's reserve energy or, failing that, by using a crystal). While in human form, Jen's health represents her presence in the demon world. If she loses all her health while in human form, she is returned to the human world, where she is in a near-death state. When this happens, the player must direct Scree to the nearest rift gate within a time limit (not seen on screen, though the voice of Arella warns the player that time is running out). If Scree does not reach a rift gate in time, Jen dies, and the game is over.\n\nThroughout the game, constant saving can prove onerous, particularly if the player wishes to backtrack and revisit certain areas. Provided a save game is present, the player may do so, and can revisit nearly all of the locations, once they have been unlocked via an in-game cutscene.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["SCE Cambridge Studio"],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":50.0,"release_date":1048550400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 4","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1oye.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12197,"name":"Project-X","summary":"Project-X is a scrolling shooter game for the Amiga computer released in 1992.

The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from.\n\nThe additional partner also allows players to cancel an opponent's Team-Up Special by inputting a Team-Up command of their own. This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual.\n\nAdditionally, the 'vigor' meter in Project Justice is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in Rival Schools), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level.\n\nAlso carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of Project Justice in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in Project Justice is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in Rival Schools. As with School Life Mode in the original Rival Schools, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of Project Justice due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub-characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":977011200,"platforms":["Arcade","Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coawt2.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3976","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Project Justice"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"4348","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-4348/"}]},{"igdb_id":13362,"name":"Probably Archery","summary":"Manipulate your wrists, elbows and shoulders to get the arrow to the bow, draw it, aim and fire!\n\nProbably Archery gives the player more control over the minutia of their joint movements with tons of crazy scenarios to conquer, multiplayer battles to fight and brutal target challenges to dominate.\n\nWith controls inspired by games like QWOP and Surgeon Simulator 2013, you must overcome a series of ridiculous challenges like shooting a hangman's rope, exterminating flying eggs in a china shop and stopping an apple-headed warrior in space.\n\nOnce you've mastered the way of the bow, test your skills in the online multiplayer modes.

This game is the second of two CAVE shoot 'em ups to be released in America with the third CAVE NTSC-U/C release being Princess Debut, and in limited print; and as a result, the US version is somewhat rare.\n\nSometime in the past, the people of the country of Parts had found a way to become immortal, but only with elderly nobles. Five of these elders—Ballossum Pench, Gabriel Hammer, Jimchuck Spanner, Olsorro Slasher, and Leonard Drill—obtained immortality, and became known as the Motoruin sages.

Push the button precisely when the leftmost \"filling gauge\" is lined up with the \"range\" on the left of it. Get within range, and you'll be rewarded-- slightly. The second gauge will fill up, just a little bit. You need to have a certain amount of successes in order to fill the second gauge all the way to the top, to advance to the next level.

It quickly sold out of its 100 copies in less than three weeks of release[1], which came with an overlay (a bit rare for Vectrex homebrews in general), were numbered and had an embossed foil logo on its box. It also came with the Spike Goes Down game included with it as well as an unlockable bonus.\n\nThen later on that year, the unlimited edition of Protector was released, although with a different game included, being Y*A*S*I, which stands for \"Yet Another Space Invaders\", as that game was a clone of that arcade classic (hence the title of this release being Protector/Y*A*S*I this time around). Again this was a bit of a surprise within the Vectrex community, as a lot of gamers in general didn't know that the Vectrex is capable of producing raster graphics as well, which Y*A*S*I proved by looking almost exactly like it's arcade cousin, having bitmapped, rather than vector graphics (note: Spike Goes Down also had raster graphics as well, it's just that this unlimited version is more well known, especially since the ROM for Spike Goes Down has yet to be released years later).

Murder Case!\") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops.\n\nThis game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":598924800,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k1rmoyd0sofxyasa0mcl.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"83416","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pro%20Yakyuu%3F%20Satsujin%20Jiken!"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"40535","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-40535/"}]},{"igdb_id":48827,"name":"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87","summary":"Not so much a sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium than an enhanced rerelease with updated rosters. It was published by Bandai for the Famicom in late 1987.\n\nPro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87 is the second game in Namco's long running Family Stadium series, also known as Famista. It's a traditional baseball game that allows one human player against the CPU, two competing human players and two competing CPU players in a \"Watch\" spectator mode.\n\nRather than being a full sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium the game is instead an updated version of the original, which was reflected in its lower price at release. It adds a few features and updates the official rosters for the athletes, but is functionally identical to the original Family Stadium. This specific type of annualization would become common practice for sports game franchises such as Madden NFL and NHL.\n\nIt's worth noting that this game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. The original R.B.I. Baseball and Family Stadium were one and the same, the former receiving a name change to appeal to a Western audience, but after that initial game both franchises diverged. R.B.I. Baseball specifically favored more realistic looking athlete sprites while Family Stadium would persist with the cartoonish \"super deformed\" sprites.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Namcot"],"publishers":["Namcot"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567129600,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kkdooslw6ngurje9cdqd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"369098","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pro%20Yakyuu%20Family%20Stadium%20'87"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"42413","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-42413/"}]},{"igdb_id":48828,"name":"President no Sentaku","summary":"President no Sentaku is a Strategy game, developed by Another and published by Hot-B, which was released in Japan in 1990.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":639014400,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co745a.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"633849151","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/President%20no%20Sentaku"}]},{"igdb_id":49029,"name":"Prophecy: The Viking Child","summary":"Cartoony side-scroller where you take the role of, as the title states, a viking child, in his quest to free his friends and family, held by the evil god Loki inside the Great Halls of Valhalla.\n\nFight your way through 16 levels with diverse scenarios, including medieval castles and mountains.

However, most Mandarin-speaking Chinese now call the game má jiàng.\n\nMahjong involves skill, strategy, and calculation, as well as a certain degree of luck (depending on the variation played, luck can be anything from a minor to a dominant factor in winning). In Asia, mahjong is also popularly played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand, depending on the variation being played. On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of making four or five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or \"head\". Winning comes \"on the draw\" by drawing a new or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus, a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or seventeen) tiles.","genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Athena"],"publishers":["Athena"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":908150400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coaat8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"67014","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-67014/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"504557","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pro%20Mahjong%20Kiwame%20Plus%20II"}]},{"igdb_id":97878,"name":"Pro Mahjong Kiwame GB II","summary":null,"genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Athena"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9i14.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"504556","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pro%20Mahjong%20Kiwame%20GB%20II"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"67015","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-67015/"}]},{"igdb_id":97879,"name":"Pro Mahjong Kiwame Plus","summary":"Pro Mahjong Kiwame Plus is a mahjong game, and is the first game in the series released for the Sony PlayStation console.

It comes from the days when we use to call them PSW's (Persistent State Worlds). Nowadays most MMO games are really just PSC (Persistent State Characters) where essentially its just your character that changes and is saved. In Project Visitor you build the world around you, you attack others and the lands they have built and the whole world is saved to the database. Also the world continues to grow and battles happen, lands are lost, gained, etc even while your offline. To maintain your land you have to be involved, join a protective group called a MDN, own, mine, defend, survive! \n \nPreviously known as 10Six, it was Sega's first foray into MMO's, a persistent online RTS where players signed up for one of four mega-corporations aiming to conquer the rogue planet Visitor, which has entered the solar system and contains a treasure of valuable resources. \n \nPlayers construct and capture mining sites, construct defenses and NPC units to help defend and attack in a fairly traditional RTS mode, but much of the game also consists of player on player combat in first or third person modes, similar to Battlezone or Planetside. \n \nThe server infrastructure was designed to be able to handle a million simultaneous players and was hosted through SegaSoft's Heat.net, but never saw player counts that high. After failing to attract a sufficiently large audience Sega shut down the game in June 2002, offering refunds to anybody with subscription time left. \n \nA community effort to relaunch the game was started soon after the servers were taken down. Conundrum Studios was formed in late 2002, and the game was relaunched under the name Project Visitor in 2003.","genres":["Shooter","Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"developers":["Conundrum Studios"],"publishers":["Conundrum Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1513814400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2r0i.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":98437,"name":"Priest's Artifice: Raguna Series 2","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"65916","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-65916/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"503389","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Priest's%20Artifice%3A%20Raguna%20Series%202"}]},{"igdb_id":98586,"name":"Project 3 VR","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"65426","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-65426/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"502827","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Project%203%20VR"}]},{"igdb_id":98595,"name":"Protect Zoey from the Zombies","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"65404","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-65404/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"502849","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Protect%20Zoey%20from%20the%20Zombies"}]},{"igdb_id":98723,"name":"Professor Wordington's Spellatorium","summary":"Match wits against a progression of enemies, each one tougher than the first, in this beautifully stylized RPG-like word game from the makers of “I Dig It”.\n\nPlay against the computer or select multiplayer to challenge a friend.

Projectile Fighter is like a fighting game but mainly projectiles are used to determine the outcome of a match. Projectile fighters can use a variety of elements for projectiles including light, dark, wind, magma, earth, lightning, aqua, fire, ice, plant and unique. Unique would apply to any projectile that does not fall under any of the other elements. All elements with the exception of unique have a weakness(an element they are weak to) and a counter(an element they counter). All characters have an affinity/element that determines their strongest element, elements they are resistant to and elements they can absorb. Projectile fighters can use basic techniques to attack by throwing projectiles in various directions(horizontally or diagonally upwards while standing and diagonally downwards while jumping) and they can defend themselves by deflecting, dodging jumping over and/or absorbing projectiles. Projectile fighters can also use a long list of special techniques for attacking, defending or powering themselves up. All characters are capable of using any technique but they are most likely to use their favorite techniques. Read the in-game guide/manual to get more information about the mechanics, techniques and terminology associated with the game. Projectile Fighter includes music and features a soundtrack with 7 tracks. Various types of projectiles include light energy, dark vortex, tornado(wind), magma ball, meteor(earth), lightning bolt, aqua ball, fire ball, ice spike, leaf(plant), wood(plant), ki energy, diamond, energy beam, eye beam, shock wave, shuriken, twilight energy, twilight vortex and star. Various classes/types of characters include normal, android, mage, swordsman, ninja, hybrid, alien and deity.

Powered by a massive 5-liter V8 engine and delivering more than 428hp of power and 528 Nm of torque, buyers can choose between a full manual and automatic six-speed gearbox, the latter coming with genuine shifting paddles – a first in the long history of the Mustang.\n\nBased on the Porsche 911 3.2, the 1987 CTR Yellowbird is one of Ruf’s most iconic models that has helped build Ruf's reputation for building no-compromise sports cars. The 3.4 liter twin-turbocharged flat six engine provided 469hp from two large turbo chargers & intercoolers and had been equipped with a new Bosch Motronic as well as an ignition setup originally designed for Porsche’s 962 Group C race car. Thanks to extensive weight-saving measures such as usage of fiberglass and aluminum, the CTR weighs just 1150 kilograms, resulting in a very impressive performance.\n\nBMW's 2002 Turbo road car made the history books in 1973 by becoming Europe's first-ever mass-produced road car powered by a turbocharged engine. The 2002 Turbo's two-liter four cylinder engine provided 170hp of power, a figure that made the 2002 one of the most powerful cars on the road during its time. Unfortunately, the 1974 oil crisis forced an end to the 2002 Turbo's production after just one year as gas prices were soaring across the world. Only 1672 cars were produced during the model's limited production run, making the 2002 Turbo one of BMW's most iconic and most sought-after classics.\nBuilt to the Super 2000 touring car regulations, the 320TC is BMW's weapon of choice for competition in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) and countless national touring car series around the globe.\nWeighing 1170 kilograms, the car is powered by a 1.6 litreDI-turbo four-cylinder engine and a full adjustable six-speed sequential gearbox. Driven by veteran touring car aces such as Tom Coronel, Franz Engstler & Stefano D'Aste, the 320TC clinched five world championship wins.","genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Slightly Mad Studios"],"publishers":["Slightly Mad Studios","Bandai Namco Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1451520000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co834o.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":1,"store":"steam","uid":"334774","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/334774"}]},{"igdb_id":120195,"name":"Project CARS: Modified Car Pack","summary":"Add three limited-run custom machines to your garage with the Modified Car Pack – the Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster, Ariel Atom 3 Mugen, and the all-new Ruf CTR3 SMS-R…\n\nWith only five chassis ever built, the Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster is an open-top hypercar with a monstrous top speed, racecar levels of downforce, and extravagant beauty to match its multi-million dollar price tag.\n\nCreated in celebration of the ten year anniversary of the original ground-breaking track racer, the Ariel Atom 3 takes just 2.9 seconds to go from 0-60.\n\nFurther blurring the lines between reality and gaming, the Ruf CTR3 SMS-R is the result of a collaboration between veteran developers Slightly Mad Studios and Ruf to make a race-spec version of the already-impressive CTR3 super sports car.","genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Slightly Mad Studios"],"publishers":["Bandai Namco Entertainment","Slightly Mad Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1451520000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co834n.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":1,"store":"steam","uid":"334771","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/334771"}]},{"igdb_id":120196,"name":"Project CARS: Audi Ruapuna Speedway Expansion","summary":"The first Track Expansion for Project CARS includes Prototype and GT cars from Audi, and a new location to race at: New Zealand motor racing circuit Ruapuna Park…\n\n- Ruapuna Park GP\n-Ruapuna Park Club\n- Ruapuna Park Outer Loop\n- Ruapuna Park A Circuit\n- Ruapuna Park B Circuit\n- Audi R8 LMP900\n- Audi R18 e-tron Quattro\n- Audi 90 IMSA GTO","genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Slightly Mad Studios"],"publishers":["Slightly Mad Studios","Bandai Namco Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1437436800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co834i.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":1,"store":"steam","uid":"334773","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/334773"}]},{"igdb_id":120197,"name":"Project CARS: Racing Icons Car Pack","summary":"Expand your Prototype and GT rosters with two uncompromising and beautiful machines from the prestigious heritage of Bentley – the Speed 8 and Continental GT3 - and three further racing icons: the Le Mans-winning BMW V12 LMR and McLaren F1 GTR, and the Mercedes-Benz CLK LM.","genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["Slightly Mad Studios"],"publishers":["Slightly Mad Studios","Bandai Namco Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1451520000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co834m.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"334772","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/334772"}]},{"igdb_id":120422,"name":"Project DeepWeb","summary":"Welcome to the DeepWeb.

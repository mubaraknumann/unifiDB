The player's mission was to find and destroy the orb. \n \nPhantasie II used the same graphics and fighting as the original Phantasie game, with one improvement to combat: the ability of any character class to target any enemy rank with a thrown rock. There were improvements in the complexity of quests, but little was done to innovate the series. One option which endeared many veterans was the ability to transfer characters from Phantasie I to this sequel. \n \nThe manual included in Phantasie II was identical to the one included with Phantasie, plus a small card explaining the differences. Computer Gaming World noted this was advantageous in terms of how players of the original would have an easier time getting into the game, but disadvantageous as to some particularly tedious mechanisms of both games, particularly \"the infamous Distribution and Selling rigamarole.\" The review continued to note that characters imported from the original have their equipment removed as well as most of their gold and experience, affording only a slight head start over newly created characters.[","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","Bothtec, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536371200,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Atari ST/STE","Apple II","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gbnjqbasglrvsarmkpp0.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":null,"uid":"3847","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Phantasie%20II"},{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"4212","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-4212/"}]},{"igdb_id":107097,"name":"Pharaoh Miracle Legend","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":91670,"name":"Phono Alliance","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":209969,"name":"Pharaoh ISO","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":55403,"name":"Phantom Warfare","summary":"Phantom Warfare is a team-based FPS game, designed exclusively for VR.

Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.\n\nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["Nippon Ichi Software"],"publishers":["Nippon Ichi Software","NIS America","Tecmo Koei Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1288224000,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2h53.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":308506,"name":"Photographic Memory Test","summary":"Memorize a photo in 1 minute and answer the quiz!\nYour memory will be tested with a very difficult quiz.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1721260800,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8ig6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":159405,"name":"Photo-Life: Rina's Journey","summary":"Travel with Rina during a year as a photographer! 75 Pictures to unlock in Story & Extra modes.

Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.\n\nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["System Prisma","Nippon Ichi Software"],"publishers":["Nippon Ichi Software","Koei","NIS America"],"aggregated_rating":86.5,"release_date":1074729600,"platforms":["Wii","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation Portable","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3bg0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":301698,"name":"Phantom Watcher","summary":"Phantom Watcher is a chilling horror-strategy game.

While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":83.5,"release_date":1187827200,"platforms":["Wii","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5z8u.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"7232","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Phoenix%20Wright:%20Ace%20Attorney%20-%20Trials%20and%20Tribulations"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"7894","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-7894/"}]},{"igdb_id":305185,"name":"Phoenix Wright: Legends of Liability","summary":"In an unexpected turn of events, Redd White is your client to protect his company, Bluecorp, from a class action lawsuit.

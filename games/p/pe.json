To achieve this objective, you must avoid missiles launched by your competitors, among other things. One way to counter this is the barrel roll maneuver, which is a quick and effective way to avoid unexpected hurdles on the tracks. In the beginning, you drive a pretty unimpressive racer. However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car. You have 13 different racer body styles and nine tracks to choose from. The cartoony racers zip through city streets, ice caves, and a volcano, and with the Track Create mode, you can design the wildest track you can imagine. When you toss four-player racing into the fray, the fun quadruples as the action intensifies and the losers are utterly humiliated.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Locomotive Corporation"],"publishers":["Takara","THQ"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":900633600,"platforms":["Nintendo 64"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6dsi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":1463,"name":"Perfect Dark","summary":"Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 video game console.

It was released in 1982 as a clone of the Scramble arcade game.\n\nIn Penetrator, the gamer flies a ship, which can shoot forwards and drop bombs beneath the ship. The first level is on open air, with just mountains to dodge, missiles which try to hit the ship, and animated radars. From the second level onwards, the game is inside increasingly complex caverns, so the ceiling is also a danger, as well as new enemies - the missiles are now sometimes replaced with skulls that can move up and down, blocking the path.\n\nThe levels change with no pause, only the screen colour changes. After four levels there is a short fifth level where a base needs to be destroyed by dropping a bomb precisely, and then there is a firework animation as a reward. After all levels are finished, the ship goes back through inversed levels, with backward turned landscape.\n\nReviews at the time said that graphics and the game were impressive, even stunning.[1]\n\nThere is an edit mode for designing levels, and a training mode with infinite number of lives in which one can start from any level. Also, there is a simultaneous two-player mode. The game's sound consisted of a characteristic uplifting theme before ship launch, while in-game there were simultaneous shooting/explosion effects, which was relatively advanced use of the limited one channel Spectrum beeper system at the time.\n\nLater, versions for Commodore 64 and TRS-80 appeared.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Beam Software"],"publishers":["Melbourne House"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","PC (Microsoft Windows)","TRS-80"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7i2j.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":26009,"name":"Penny-Punching Princess","summary":"\"In a world ruled by capitalism, cash is king!\n\nUse the money you gather to bribe enemies to fight for you, activate deadly traps with your dough, and when all else fails, smash all that stand against you with your fists!

There are 99 levels and the game loops endlessly, as typical of most early arcade games. The main problem with Performan is that he's far too weak to survive for long. He can't move quickly, his shots are slow, and he can only have one shot on screen at a time, which can easily be dodged.

His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin.

But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him.

And to think that it all started only because the two wanted to drink some beer... one event led to another, and in the end the heroes have to face ultimate evil in a scenario that is in many ways a parody on the famed Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of the previous games in the series, being a traditional puzzle-solving adventure.

The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.\n\nHis objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.\n\nAs the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero's Handbook\" and Harry's off to adventure. The \"Hero's Handbook's\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are.

If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him.\n\nSometimes during matches the player will come across foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at you or your opponent. The player may also come across a power-up known as the \"power pill\". If the player or the opponent grab this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits.\n\nAt times even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man (Milt Loper) and Knife Woman (Dianne Bertucci), will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit. Sometimes there is also a fat bearded man with a stick. If the player knocks him down, the player can take the stick and use it against the current opponent.\n\nThe audience will also push any fighter that ends up among them, and stays there more than a few seconds. They will be forced back into the fighting area.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":["Atari Games"],"publishers":["Atari Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":649468800,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coakwp.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"12530","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-12530/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"11511","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pit-Fighter"}]},{"igdb_id":6862,"name":"Pilotwings Resort","summary":"Pilotwings Resort, an aerial adventure featuring airplanes, hang gliders and rocket belts.

Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":["The Assembly Line","The Assembly Line","The Assembly Line","The Assembly Line","The Assembly Line"],"publishers":["Lucasfilm Games","Empire Software","Empire Software","Empire Software","Lucasfilm Games","Empire Software","Lucasfilm Games","Lucasfilm Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":612662400,"platforms":["Acorn Archimedes","BBC Microcomputer System","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Atari ST/STE","Acorn Electron","Mac","DOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5vvz.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"2779","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-2779/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2548","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pipe Dream"}]},{"igdb_id":38053,"name":"Pinball Magic","summary":"Pinball Magic is an early pinball game by French company Loriciel.\n\nIn a nice twist to regular pinball tables, here you have to clear tables by activating all letters, which opens the exit to the next table.","genres":["Pinball"],"developers":["Loriciel"],"publishers":["Loriciel"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6tsb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38144,"name":"Pikiinya!","summary":"Pikiinya! is a Japan-exclusive action-puzzle video game developed by Crea-Tech and published by ASCII, which was released in 1997 for the Super Famicom.\n\nPikiinya! takes the Tetris-esque formula of blocks falling from the sky, and adds gyrating tropical-type penguins.

Momotaro has no attacks of his own. However, he has the ability to grab barrels, drums, large bags, and various other items which he can throw (either horizontally or vertically) across the screen. Any pirate who stands in the way of a barrel or other object will be hurled off the screen. Barrels that impact the walls of a stage or other barrels or objects will shatter and produce points, while other objects are invulnerable (but do not produce points). Each successive enemy that is hit by a barrel will yield additional points once the barrel is destroyed. In addition, there are also various items hidden beneath barrels in each level which will give Momotaro bonus points. Every floor of the ship has a set number of pirates to be destroyed, as well as a single \"Bow\", a special pirate that regenerates each time it is defeated. Every fourth level in the game yields a bonus level in which the barrels are worth an increased number of points, and a group of enemies entirely made up of Bows (which do not regenerate in this case). With each successive floor, the speed and intelligence of the pirates increases. For every sixteen barrels Momotaro destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them. Momotaro's enemies do not have attacks, but a single touch from an enemy will cause him to die and be revived, costing the player one of his/her extra lives; the game will be over when he or she has no more lives. The game has no ending, but following the sixteenth level, the enemy patterns will reset to level one. The layout of the barrels on the stages will continue to change, however, and the enemy count per level will not reset to level one counts.

In Reiner Knizia’s popular dice game, 16 barbecue worm portions with different values are waiting on the grill to be snatched up by the dice-throwing chickens. The rules are simple, but don’t push your luck too far: To get your claws into one of the delicious worms, you roll all 8 dice at the same time. You then pick a value from your throw and remove all the dice showing the same value, before throwing the remaining dice again. If your score corresponds to an available barbecue worm portion on the grill you can take this portion - or maybe even grab a portion from the plate of your fellow players! You’ll need both the luck of the dice and the right strategy: Stick with your score, or roll the dice just one more time to get a better portion.

The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.\n\nHis objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.\n\nAs the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero's Handbook\" and Harry's off to adventure. The \"Hero's Handbook's\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"developers":["Torus Games"],"publishers":["Activision","Nikko"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1077062400,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance","Digiblast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co87vu.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":209676,"name":"Pizza Delivery Bagel","summary":"Work the most insane pizza delivery job of all time, and try to make as much money as possible before you get fired!","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1659052800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5khp.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1996780","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996780"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"105623822","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pizza%20Delivery%20Bagel"}]},{"igdb_id":209954,"name":"Pirate Hunter","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":209955,"name":"Pirate Poppers","summary":null,"genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Mystery Studio"],"publishers":["PlayFirst"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7yup.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":209958,"name":"Pinball Deluxe","summary":"A pinball game for Nintendo DS by Anuman Interactive, only released in Europe.","genres":["Pinball"],"developers":["Anuman Interactive"],"publishers":["Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1262217600,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6wt6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":209959,"name":"Pinball Master","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["eGames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":209960,"name":"Pinobee","summary":"Late ps1 release.

The game is based on 30 sequential levels (10 \"worlds\" of 3 levels each) and two different possible endings. In the game you have to collect all the ten colors (starting with a simple white you should reach red, green, blu, etc...) avoiding enemies, overtaking enigmas and fighting bosses. Collecting colors is mandatory to reach the next levels and to use some active elements inside the worlds (the player can switch between the colours so that the character will be able to use the element of that same color). The player is required to avoid traps and to be able to move around a world where everything may do harm or result in a game over. There's a shop system where you can buy powerups after having collect enough in-game coins. There are 5 levels of difficulty (from very easy to impossible), two languages (italian and english), an extra item you can buy in the shop after completing the game, original musics (made by the developer) and 3D prerendered sprites. A cheats system is provided. You can purchase the official guide (but it's italian only) to master the game and to learn the codes for the cheat system. A Windows computer is required in order to play but someone managed to run it on Linux. RTX20xx with at least 3 GB VRAM is reccomanded. You can download the game for free: it has been released on itch.io and no payment is required (you can donate though naming your own price).","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1740700800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ioc.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1430064289","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pixel54"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3362573","url":"https://joysurrender.itch.io/pixel54"}]},{"igdb_id":335081,"name":"Pixicharm: Mariana Gold","summary":null,"genres":["Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Erdem Sen"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1741305600,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ire.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10014409","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014409"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1248402383","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pixicharm:%20Mariana%20Gold"}]},{"igdb_id":335083,"name":"Pix Arts Masters Tennis","summary":"Realistic, true physics, local multiplayer, Tennis Game","genres":["Simulator","Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Pix Arts"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1741132800,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation 5","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9j1d.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"10014033","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014033"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1155742670","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pix%20Arts%20Masters%20Tennis"}]},{"igdb_id":335349,"name":"Picross S Doraemon & F Characters Edition","summary":"The Picross S series for Nintendo Switch welcomes characters from the world of Fujiko·F·Fujio!\n\nFrom universally adored classics like Doraemon and Kiteretsu Encyclopedia to the more mature SF Short Stories, this collaboration features an incredible lineup of 28 works in total.\n\nSolve Picross puzzles to bring iconic characters and memorable scenes to life as charming pixel art.\n\nEnjoy solving puzzles solo or with friends and family, and immerse yourself in the nostalgia and fresh discoveries of Fujiko·F·Fujio’s timeless creations!\n\nThe game features four Picross modes familiar from the Picross S series: Picross, Mega Picross, Color Picross, and Clip Picross, as well as the Extra bonus content.\n\nThe number of puzzles is 150 each for Picross and Mega Picross and 5 for Clip Picross for a total of 200 piece puzzles of 40 each, 30 for Color Picross and 5 for Extra.\n\nPicross is a picture crossword puzzle game where you follow hint number to complete a picture.

Each floor is a freshly generated grid of interconnected rooms, packed with randomized enemies, destructible obstacles, and hidden treasures. Your hero starts modestly equipped—three hearts, basic sword reach, and no special powers—but every playthrough offers new opportunities to power up via treasure chests, vending machines, and a unique letter‑collecting mechanic.\n\nThe heart of the game lies in its letter system. Scattered throughout the dungeon are consumable letters that spell out SUBPIXEL and MATTA. Completing the former permanently extends your sword’s reach; completing the latter grants a limited‑use ranged projectile attack.

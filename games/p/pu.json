Arle Nadja embarks on a quest to defeat him in this competitive puzzle game.\n\nThis is the 3rd installment of the Puyo Puyo games series, and the sequel to Puyo Puyo Tsu. After the highly acclaimed success of its predecessor, Compile took a slightly more retro approach, so players had a more original feel to the game over that of Tsu.\n\nThe name of Puyo Puyo SUN comes from a Japanese pun on san, and also indicates a new Puyo brought into the game. As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (san (三)) is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes.\nThis game was released only in Japan.\n\nFollowing the arcade release, Puyo Puyo Sun was ported to the then-current home consoles. The Saturn version was released merely three months after the arcade release, while the other ports were released in late 1997 and throughout 1998. The Saturn, PlayStation, and Windows 95 versions feature fully voiced cutscenes unlike the original ST-V version.","genres":["Puzzle","Arcade"],"developers":["Compile"],"publishers":["Compile"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":855878400,"platforms":["Nintendo 64","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob3ut.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":3579,"name":"Puyo Puyo~n","summary":"This game was released only in Japan.

Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Compile"],"publishers":["Sega","Compile"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":920505600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Nintendo 64","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable","Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zkx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":3676,"name":"Puss in Boots","summary":"In the years before meeting Shrek & Donkey in Shrek 2, Puss in Boots must clear his name from all charges against him that has made him a wanted fugitive.

There is the option of using the weapon power bar, which consists of two halves. The right-hand side of the bar turns blue when the fire button is depressed. When fully charged the ship delivers a devastating emission of energy. The left-hand side turns red when it is continually pressed, shooting out a barrage of smaller, rapid blasts.\n\nThe in-game visuals are mostly pre-rendered 3D graphics, which gives the interactive elements a far more realistic appearance. Great care was taken to really place the player into the world of the game, with cinematic style cut scenes and pre-rendered movies.\n\nThere is a hefty reliance on strategy and not just blasting everything in sight. Using the charged weapon is key, and requires careful precision. Also, once a power up is obtained, a small orb appears at the posterior end of the ship. This can be used as an advantage by deflecting/absorbing oncoming enemy fire and taking out small enemies that run into it.","genres":["Shooter","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Aicom"],"publishers":["SNK"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":791251200,"platforms":["Neo Geo AES","Arcade","Neo Geo MVS","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Neo Geo CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w28.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":7391,"name":"Puppeteer","summary":"One dark moonlit night, a young boy named Kutaro was carried away by the maleficent Moon Bear King to a black castle where the unlucky lad was transformed into a puppet.\n\nKutaro displeased the terrible tyrant, who devoured the boy's wooden head and cast away his body.

Notably, the game was sponsored by Smiths' British snack Quavers (now owned by Walkers), where the game plot revolves around the then Quavers mascot 'Colin Curly' losing his Quavers packets down a giant ant hill. The player is then tasked with controlling 'G.I. Ant', a large soldier ant, to recover the Quavers by solving a series of puzzles. The SNES version lacks the Quavers branding, and instead the aim is to recover bundles of cash dropped down the ant hill by Captain Rat.\n\nThe game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds. Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of \"dominoes\". The aim is to rearrange the dominoes, such that with a single push, all of the dominoes are toppled, thus opening the exit to the next level. There are 11 different types of domino, identified by red and yellow patterns, each with different actions. The player controls G.I. Ant, who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time.\n\nVarious factors can result in failure to complete a level. As well as toppling all of the dominoes, the player must be able to access the exit door once the dominoes have fallen. For instance, the player will be unable to reach the exit if a ledge leading to the exit has been destroyed, or if a gap leading to the exit has not been bridged, or if a line of dominoes lie across the exit. G.I. Ant may die by falling from a large height, by falling off the bottom of the screen, or by being crushed under a falling domino. The player is then greeted with the message \"You Failed, You Died\" and has to restart the level. Also, the level will be failed if any dominoes are destroyed by landing one domino on top of another.\n\nEach level has a time limit during which it must be completed. However, if the time runs out the player is still able to continue with the puzzle if they wish. By pausing the game once the time has run out, a small hint will be displayed, giving advice on how to complete the level. As a side note, the hint for level 98 informs the player that the game's designer cannot remember how to complete the level without trickery (\"Use a drop! There is a way to make it work with a push, but I can't find it!\").\n\nThe themed worlds, in order, are an industrial complex, an Aztec world, a space station, an electronic world, a Greek temple, a Medieval castle, a Meccano-inspired world, a dungeon and a Japanese temple. Each world has 11 levels, making a total of 99 regular levels. A packet of Colin's Quavers is retrieved after each world, with nine packets in all to be collected. Many of the early levels are tutorials demonstrating how each type of domino will act. Often there is only a single solution to each level, though some levels have multiple solutions. The final level, level 100, must be completed using dominoes with hidden markings.\n\nA password system allows the player to continue an earlier game, without having to restart from the first level. Additionally, upon completing a level the player gains a token, which once a level has been failed, allows the player to return to the point before the domino push, rather than having to return to the initial state of the level.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Red Rat Software"],"publishers":["Ocean Software","Piko Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725760000,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Atari ST/STE","PC (Microsoft Windows)","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5z4a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11775,"name":"Punch Line","summary":"Punch Line is an upcoming Japanese adventure game with puzzle elements and is based on the Punch Line multimedia franchise.

The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent’s grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you’ve won the game.

Get accurate and knock enemies off into pits. Figure out how to survive being thrown into the abyss. Think fast and act faster, and you just might be the last one standing.\nYou're given absolute minimal equipment so you can focus on strategy. Laser guns that do no damage but have extremely high knockback, Primary fire shoots a laser that doesn't do a lot of push, but is very accurate and very, very fast. Secondary fire lobs an energy grenade that has short range and arcs downward, but has massive amounts of knockback and can rocketjump like nothing else. Gauntlets that can send people careening off into the distance with a single (lucky) blow. And a double-jump to help with recovery.\n\nIt's all so simple. So, so simple.

Once a row has been completed, the blocks will turn to bricks, and cannot be moved. Two modes are present in the game - \"Pacman Story\" and \"Floor Exercise\" - with Pac-Man only appearing in the former.\n\nPacman Story features the Pac-Land incarnations of various characters, fully animated, as the tilepieces. Upon completing a level it shows an intermission, featuring a zoomed-in Pac-Man character that is identical to the regular tile(s). After thirty levels, the game ends, displaying the credits. The Floor Exercise mode is incomplete and impossible to finish; instead of Pac-Man tiles, it features generic slot machine graphics. In place of Pacman Story's intermissions, Floor Exercise also has bonus rounds, featuring a large puzzle of a girl lifting weights.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5bfu.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":218511,"name":"Puzzle by Nikoli W: Sudoku","summary":"Sudoku is a puzzle in which you place numbers from 1 to 9 into a 9x9 grid, divided into horizontal and vertical lines and 3x3 blocks, filling up all of the spaces with the numbers.

This game actually started out life as Trail of the Pink Panther by U.S. Games (based on the then current movie), but when U.S. Games went out of business they sold the rights to North American Phillips (NAP) who decided to release their own version of the game through their Probe 2000 division. It is unknown if any work was already done on the U.S. Games version or if any of those ideas were used in the Probe 2000 version of the game. Although Pursuit of the Pink Panther was heavily marketed at the June 1983 CES, it was never released, most probably because the special RAM/ROM chip that NAP used to squeeze all the graphics and gameplay elements into the game couldn't be reliably manufactured. When the first batch of chips came back defective from the manufacturer NAP decided to cancel the game rather than try and find a new source for the chips. The crumbling game market at the time was also a big factor in choosing not to go forward. Description: 'Players control the Pink Panther as he sneakily makes his way through several screens, attempting to outwit the Inspector. For his final challenge, he must dangle from a swinging rope, steal the famous Pink Panther diamond and escape unnoticed.'","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["James Wickstead Design Associates"],"publishers":["Probe 2000"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mos.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":283379,"name":"Puzzlink","summary":null,"genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1704240000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7nh7.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1390099481","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Puzzlink"},{"category":5,"store":"gog","uid":"1707953012","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/puzzlink"}]},{"igdb_id":284291,"name":"Push Push Boom","summary":"Alice, the protagonist of the game, enters a different world by mistake and finds that all the delicious food she likes has become a monster that can eat people.

The game can be played cooperatively, with the first and second players controlling Pac-Man and Pikachu respectively. As with Pac-Man, the goal is to collect all the pellets in the level while avoiding enemies that patrol the level. They can take on the appearance of the traditional ghosts Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, and two \"Pokémon\", a blue rabbit creature (which resembles the first enemy in Gamtec's Pocket Monster) and a green caterpillar resembling Caterpie. None of the enemies seem to follow any player-tracking system like most Pac-Man games and the enemies simply switch between tracking the player(s) or taking detours. Once the player reaches Stage 11, every stage thereafter uses a consistent enemy selection: Blinky > Rabbit > Pinky > Inky.\n\nThere are a total of eight worlds with four levels each, divided by timed bonus levels which give chances for extra points and lives. During these bonus stages, the player can tap the fire button to accelerate, which is also possible in main stages after collecting a Wing powerup. Other items include traditional Pac-Man fruit (which do not increase in value as the game progresses), poison that reverses the player's movement direction, and a Yin-Yang symbol that refills all the pellets on a stage.\n\nUnlike regular Pac-Man titles, pellets eaten do not count towards the player's score until after the level is completed. If playing in two player, the player that eats the highest number of pellets takes all the points. For every board that is completed, the player will be shown a digitized photo of an Asian girl, out of fourteen available. Once all fourteen are shown in order, the game loops back to the first one.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":978220800,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob3wu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"783432085","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Puckman%20Pockimon%20Genie%202000"}]},{"igdb_id":382780,"name":"Pulp Race: Daft Enigma Fighter","summary":null,"genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1764460800,"platforms":["Playdate"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":383013,"name":"Purgatory","summary":"An indie RPG set in the afterlife, through a partly-dystopian, partly-vibrant, and always-dangerous lens.

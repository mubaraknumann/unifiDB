It was created by goodpea2 in collaboration with Mine Power and makes numerous changes in order to bring things more in line with what many fans loved about the original. Examples include:\n\n- Removes \"pay to play\" aspects of the game (micro transactions), allowing things to be either earned through Adventure mode or bought with in-game currency.\n- Introduces a tier system, allowing the player to strategically develop their plants for different strengths and weaknesses.\n- A re-jigged, linear narrative, with tweaked dialogue and hundreds of original levels across the game's worlds.\n- New game modes\n- Some newly designed zombies and plants\n\nThe most notable change that players will encounter is the steep difficulty. The mod not only fixes problems with the game, but also makes it incredibly challenging - this is not a fault, but an intentional change for the appeal of those who have mastered the original game and desire more of a challenge, with a much greater emphasis on strategy. This may put off some players used to the usual skill level required of players from other games in the series.\n\nUltimately, the mod is a challenging and impressive overhaul which bares very little resemblance to the original PvZ2 game.","genres":["Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["goodpea2","Mine Power"],"publishers":["goodpea2","Mine Power"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1535760000,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4uoy.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":109901,"name":"Pleasure Puzzle: Portrait","summary":"Elaborate jigsaw puzzle: 100 beautiful pictures, 100 custom difficulty, 100 game achievements.","genres":["Puzzle","Simulator","Indie"],"developers":["冷笑黑妖"],"publishers":["冷笑黑妖"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1537747200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27a1.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":297978,"name":"Playing Kafka","summary":"There are things that often fail on nothing but themselves.

These orbs, when caught by the paddle, are worth 500 points each. There are 4 levels, and the player starts with 3 lives. They may earn more lives and power-ups later. After playing, the orbs caught, depending on what kind, can be used to redeem 1 free Pokémon via the Pokémon Dream World, provided the player is signed in under their Pokémon Trainer Club account. These Pokémon are Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, and Glaceon.

The existence of Plutos has been known for some time, as a physical prototype has been in hands of a collector for years, but this prototype was known to be unstable and crash frequently. The source code for Plutos was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware.\n\nPlutos is a vertically oriented space shooter that features gameplay similar to Raiden. The game features six different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Only three of these levels are unique graphically--the other three are just color palette changes. Plutos offers one player as well as two player simultaneous modes, selectable with the left difficulty switch. Plutos also has features a unique weapons power-up system. There are three different types of weapons, each of which can be upgraded up to four times, as well as an invincibility power-up. The three different weapons are: Dual machine guns, spread gun, and energy gun.\n\nA partially compiled version of Plutos was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Plutos was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Tynesoft Computer Software"],"publishers":["Mindscape, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Atari 7800","Atari ST/STE","Amiga","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7mc9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":115533,"name":"Planet of Pirates","summary":"Planet of Pirates is a cross-platform game, which allows players to battle each other by controlling their ship in various arenas and game modes.","genres":["Shooter","Indie"],"developers":["Cyclonic Games"],"publishers":["Cyclonic Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jfy.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":101323,"name":"Platforms Unlimited","summary":"Platforms Unlimited is a procedural, minimalistic, zen, madly hard one-button endless platformer!

Although Planetfall was Meretzky's first title, it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom; it was one of five top-selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Planetfall utilizes the Z-machine originally developed for the Zork franchise and was added as a bonus to the \"Zork Anthology\".\n\nThe word planetfall is a portmanteau of planet and landfall, and occasionally used in science fiction to that effect.

Playboy: The Mansion is a social strategy game that calls on players to build a virtual empire of wealth, celebrity, and freedom from puritanical repression and intolerance. This is accomplished by developing a fully functioning Playboy mansion, to attract and accommodate influential celebrities and beautiful young models who are willing to strike the right poses. Players who can build a suitably entertaining and well-equipped mansion, while adhering to \"the Playboy philosophy,\" are rewarded with \"the Playboy lifestyle,\" surrounded by powerful trendsetters, influential pop idols, and sexually liberated young women. In short, the game invites players to take the role of a virtual Hugh Hefner.\n\nAs Hef, players will be responsible for keeping the Playboy brand relevant to its ever-evolving audience. One good way to do this is by attracting celebrity friends to the mansion, and making sure they have a good time when they visit. With enough money, players can build new facilities -- like swimming pools, movie theaters, or tennis courts -- which may have special appeal to particular celebrities. It's also a good idea to introduce these V.I.P. guests to Playmates who share their interests. The game's main interface should be familiar to Sims 2 players; characters are directed through their 3D domestic environments with mouse clicks, and clicked objects offer pop-up menus of available interactions.\n\nCoaxing powerful celebrity friends to appear in an issue of Playboy magazine can boost circulation, bringing in more income for future developments. As Hef, players can determine the content of each issue, choosing the articles, essays, cover shots, and centerfolds. They'll also have an opportunity to direct the photo shoots, choosing the location on the mansion grounds, the model, and the wardrobe selection -- all of which feature a \"topless\" option. The game includes a structured campaign that follows Hefner's real-life rise to international celebrity through a series of individual scenarios that focus on building the fame, circulation, and clout it took to develop the Playboy brand into what it is today. Players design their own challenges in the \"Empire\" mode, where they can set their own goals and victory conditions.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Cyberlore Studios"],"publishers":["Arush Entertainment","Groove Games"],"aggregated_rating":55.0,"release_date":1106611200,"platforms":["Xbox","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co94ha.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":62227,"name":"Plus Plum 2","summary":"Plus Plum 2 is a Puzzle game, published by Takuyo.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Takuyo"],"publishers":["Takuyo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1074124800,"platforms":["Xbox"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co706x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":261923,"name":"Pleasure Zones","summary":"Unlock the Secrets of the Pleasure Zones\n\nThe hottest girls of Vivid are waiting for your special touch, including the gorgeous Racquel Darrian, Janine, Kelly O'Dell, Ashlyn Gere and more.

Ghosts will exit the Ghost Home to the right if their target position happens to be there. In the original game, they will only exit to the right if the behavior mode (i.e. scatter, chase, frightened) changes while they are in the Ghost Home.\n\nIf a bonus fruit appears and Pac-Man eats a ghost, the timer that controls how long the fruit stays onscreen halts with everything else. This makes it impossible for fruit to disappear while Pac-Man is eating a ghost.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820368000,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co53zi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":280094,"name":"Paper Sky","summary":"Experience the rush of an adrenaline-fueled paper plane adventure in an interactive semi-open world.

Perhaps the best-remembered of all TI-99/4A games, it is a side-scrolling shooter, programmed in 1982 by Jim Dramis (who also programmed the popular TI-99/4A games Car Wars and Munch Man) and Paul Urbanus.\n\nThe player in Parsec pilots a spaceship through sixteen differently-colored levels of play which scroll horizontally over the screen. The objective is to avoid being shot by an enemy ship, colliding with any flying object and/or the ground, and destroy all enemy ships without overheating one's laser cannon.\n\nThree waves of fighters attack, alternating with three waves of cruisers. Enemy ships enter the screen one at a time. A ship flying off the left edge of the screen wraps around to the right side and attacks again. A new fighter can appear with others still on the screen, whereas a new cruiser will not come until the previous one is destroyed. The fighters pose only the threat of collision, while the cruisers fire on the player's ship. The fighter types are named Swoopers, LTFs (Light Triangular Fighters), and Saucers. The cruisers are called Urbites, Dramites, and Bynites. Each level ends with an asteroid belt, in which an array of asteroids advance on the ship and must be avoided or shot. At the end of each asteroid belt, any remaining asteroids are cleared away and the color of the ground is changed, then a new wave of Swoopers begins. Starting with level 4, the Swoopers are preceded by a random number of Killer Satellites, which come without the usual computer warning.\n\nThe Urbites and Dramites appear to be named after the developers of the game, while the Bynites were apparently named after Don Bynum (the manager of TI's Personal Computer Division) or possibly named after the fact that they have invisibility (by night). In fact, Paul Urbanus signed Internet posts as late as 2005 as \"urbite\".","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Texas Instruments Incorporated"],"publishers":["Texas Instruments Incorporated"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Texas Instruments TI-99"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ap4ltb42lektozl2kwkp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":325677,"name":"Parawhy","summary":null,"genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1491955200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co95k8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":236454,"name":"Party Shift","summary":"Get ready to party with your friends!

For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.\n\nAs in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.","genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Grandslam Entertainments","Enix Corporation","Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":460166400,"platforms":["Arcade","Sharp X68000","PC-8800 Series","Atari ST/STE","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","iOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co38z4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":239305,"name":"Parasite Black","summary":"Parasite Black is a mature, dark fantasy adult RPG sandbox game, with turn-based combat and VN style sandbox exploration, set in the world of Mirnos, a world under the fierce onslaught of a dangerous, bizarre race known as the Demorai.","genres":["Point-and-click","Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure","Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Damned Studios"],"publishers":["Damned Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1630454400,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7i29.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":367489,"name":"Paper Depths","summary":"In a retro-futuristic office run by machines, help Florence complete the work across looping tasks.

The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Nerd Games"],"publishers":["Eastasiasoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1623110400,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3k3u.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":130500,"name":"Paragon: The Overprime","summary":"Paragon: The Overprime is a free team-based TPS Action MOBA.

However, Pacar is more-so a clone of Puck-Man than a true Head-On sequel. \n \nThe player controls \"Pacar\", a \"mischievous\" green car through a maze of roads. The objective of the game is to \"delete\" all of the small red \"dots\" scattered around the playfield, building up points for a high score. The joystick allows Pacar to move in the proposed direction, assuming it is possible to do so. Like Pac-Man, Pacar does not stop moving unless it hits a wall, however unlike Pac-Man, it is not possible to rotate 180 degrees on the spot - moving in the opposite direction causes Pacar to reverse, and reversing is significantly slower than driving normally. Ideally the player should plan his or her route to avoid reversing altogether. \n \n1 or 2 allows Pacar to move faster across the board. Driving off the edge of the screen makes Pacar appear at the other side, again similar to Pac-Man. \n \nThe game has Pacar avoid two types of enemy, also depicted as cars. Blue cars spawn from the garage at the centre of the screen and wander around the play area, only following Pacar if it is close by. Red cars spawn randomly on the road behind Pacar, and are much more aggressive with their tactics. Red cars also differ in that if Pacar speeds up, they will also increase their speed. If either car crashes into Pacar under normal conditions, the player loses a life. \n \nUnder certain conditions the game's equivalent of Pac Man's power pellets appear after deleting smaller dots. These give Pacar \"temporary invincibility\" turning it purple in the process, and act as the only form of attack against oppoents. While purple, the player is free to crash into as many cars as he or she likes, and is granted extra points in the process (starting at 200 and doubling for each successive hit, i.e. 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 etc.). It will also slow down red cars. Though there are typically fewer enemies on-screen in Pacar than Pac-Man, the fact that blue cars spawn from the garage instantly after being deleted means it is possible to achieve much higher point combos. \n \nThere are only two maps in Pacar, which cycle endlessly until the player dies. The game claims it is \"three dimensional\" as some roads in map 1 act as bridges over other roads. Once both maps are completed the player proceeds to the next \"round\", in which more blue cars are added to the playfield (with the exception of round 4, in which the three \"normal\" blue cars are replaced with one faster blue car. Round 5 will then add a second faster car and so on). \n \nExtra lives are awarded every 10,000 points.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":441676800,"platforms":["SG-1000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s22blbmsivtcforiqfvp.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":null,"uid":"509740","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pacar"},{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"70434","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-70434/"}]},{"igdb_id":323901,"name":"Paper Luigi's Mansion","summary":null,"genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Twinimage"],"publishers":["Twinimage"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1175472000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":123380,"name":"Paws and Claws: Pet Vet 2","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["THQ"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":93628,"name":"Parasitus: Ninja Zero","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":78557,"name":"Packs Mega Sammlung","summary":"magnussoft","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":99382,"name":"Paper Sounds","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":85898,"name":"Pachinko","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":204687,"name":"Passage","summary":"Passage: is a job interview simulator!\nAn intense visual novel adventure based on real-life experiences!\nWill you nail the interview process and impress your future employer?

After the setback in front of Moscow in 1941, the mighty German Army surged forward again in the summer of '42. After defeating an ill-fated Soviet summer offensive at Kharkov in May, they drove onward to the outskirts of Stalingrad by the late summer of that year. This is where the Stalingrad '42 game picks up the fight, including a number of scenarios covering the drive to the Volga. After several months of bloody house to house fighting in the fall, the Soviet positions were reduced to pockets of rubble, barely 300 meters from the Volga. As the season turned to winter, Hitler remained fixated on taking the city, ultimately leading to disaster for his troops. He had badly underestimated the Soviet army's ability to mount an offensive on his flanks. The Russians cut through weak, poorly equipped, Rumanian troops and encircled the entire Sixth Army. In Stalingrad '42 you can re-fight this titanic struggle, exploring both the historical situation in addition to a number of plausible \"What If\" situations; a German retreat, a corseted flank defense, or a powerful panzer rescue force made available had Rommel been successful at El Alamein.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":52023,"name":"Parascientific Escape: Crossing at the Farthest Horizon","summary":"The fusion of puzzle solving escape game and command selection adventure game - Parascientific Escape series Vol.3 - is here!","genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Intense Co.

The game was developed for the multi-user interactive computer-based education PLATO system and programmed in the TUTOR programming language and utilized scalable vector graphics called linesets. A 1977 development of Panther, with more refined graphics, was named Panzer.\n\nThe game features team-based deathmatch. There are two teams, Squares and Triangles. The object of the game is to destroy the opposing team's base. Game play is straightforward; the player selects a pseudonym and a team, traverse the terrain looking for enemies to destroy on the way to their base. Perspective is maintained by the use of scalable vector graphics and visual interest is enhanced with special graphics for explosions using a custom character set to accomplish limited raster graphics animation.\n\nWhen players enter the game their tanks are placed randomly in the playing arena near their bases and are temporarily camouflaged to allow time to orient themselves with the current map and state of play. The initial view of the game is in \"on-board\" mode, which is a first-person perspective of the arena. The other main view available is the map which shows the 5 mountains (Crag, Nixon, Og, Pathos, and Red) which vary in size and placement each time a new game is started. On the map view players can see all of their team members positions and can see enemies only when they are within range. Messaging between team members is available and broadcast-style messages (insults) to the opposing team are also allowed. Team coordination and cooperation is critical to winning in this game as each player has different skills, some players are better at hunting down and killing enemies (or at least engaging and distracting them), others are good at hiding and sneaking to the opposing base to begin bombardment. An interesting capability of the game is that players can donate ammunition and fuel to other players in order to facilitate their role in the game. Ammunition and fuel are loaded at the player's base.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":189216000,"platforms":["PLATO"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7w06.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":55962,"name":"Pachinko CR Daiku no Gen-san GB","summary":"A pachinko game for Game Boy, based on the Hammerin' Harry series.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Nippon Telenet"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":889747200,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9hsi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":83264,"name":"Pakacuda","summary":"Underwater maze game","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hvbmfweyrhrfy661buvb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":149367,"name":"Paranormal Enteties","summary":"This game was created in 10 days for the 2020 Scream Jam.

But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl. And remember - You Gotta Believe! PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm. The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow. You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back. Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased. Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage. Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps. Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!\n\nThe PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.

However, in the case of pantomime you get three points per word. Each round, you can pick which activity to do. You can decide to play it safe and choose to describe all the time, though if your opponents ace the harder activities, they will most likely beat you.\n\nYou can keep up with your current standing by checking team scores depicted as cute progress bars with each team’s color at the bottom of the screen. They show which team is closer to earning fifty points and winning the game. To see who is the reigning Partivity champion among your friends, you can check out the previous games section for the history of all played games along with each game’s winner.

It was the beginning of the 'Great Crusade' in Northern Europe by the Western Allies, yet was viewed as long overdue by the bloodied Soviets. Few realize that the casualties suffered in the three months of the summer of 1944 in Normandy rivaled the worst of the Eastern Front. The air and seaborne landings in Northern France were the largest the world has ever seen, with meticulous planning for D-Day, yet marked by a surfeit of clear goals once ashore. Both the bocage terrain and the dogged defense by the Germans resulted in the need for unexpected improvisation. Both sides had significant constraints; the British were nearing manpower exhaustion and would have to rely excessively on their armor arm, the United States had boundless resources but many of their divisions had never been in combat, while the Germans were short of everything and it was only through their ability to organize disparate troops into flexible kampfgruppen that they held the Allies for as long as they did. Ultimately, the Battle of Normandy resulted in the utter defeat of the Germans at Falaise with France and Belgium quickly liberated thereafter. The Allied advance would last till late September 1944, ending in the streets of Arnhem with Operation Market Garden. This second release in the Panzer Battles franchise is focused on many of the battles that occurred across the Calvados & Cotentin regions of Northern France. Fought across nearly three months from June 6th 1944 to August 20th 1944, actions from the D-Day landings, through the bocage fighting to the pursuit and destruction of the German forces at Falaise are included.\n\nBattles of Normandy includes 93 Scenarios – covering all sizes and situations, including specialized versions for both head to head play and vs. the computer AI.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Wargame Design Studio"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6944.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":184006,"name":"Papper and Carrot VN","summary":"from Open Comic to Interactive Story (Visual Novel) an EXPERIMENT","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":309061,"name":"Pair Horror","summary":"Nothing is scary when we work together!\nTeam up and complete a variety of games!","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["SAT-BOX"],"publishers":["SAT-BOX"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1721865600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8jhs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":27195,"name":"Parascientific Escape - Gear Detective","summary":"Parascientific Escape～Gear Detective～ is a sequal to Parascientific Escape～Cruise in the distant seas～, where the player is required to find clues and solve puzzles to escape certain situation using PSI abilities.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Intense Co.

Paranoia 2: Savior takes place shortly after the first game, putting the player back in the shoes of Major Alexander Kalashnikov as he continues his descent into the abandoned KROT-1 laboratory. The deeper Alex descends, the more he learns about the experiments that took place there, discovering that the monsters within must be eradicated at any cost.\n\nLike the first game, Paranoia 2 is a horror-oriented linear first-person shooter. The player's arsenal consists solely of realistic military weapons, such as pistols, rifles, and machine guns, which can be refilled with ammo found around the environment or scavenged from enemies. First aid kits and painkillers can be used to restore lost health points, but only painkillers are light enough to be carried and saved for later. The player is also outfitted with a retractable helmet which can be used to reduce incoming damage to the head and a gas mask which is vital for traversing areas contaminated with toxic gas.","genres":["Shooter","Indie"],"developers":["Kunst-Produkt Laboratory","Xash XT Group"],"publishers":["Kunst-Produkt Laboratory"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1424908800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3kmm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":86253,"name":"Pan-Dimensional Conga Combat","summary":"Developed in a top secret lab over the course of the past eighteen months, RGCD.DEV's Pan-Dimensional Conga Combat is a rhythm-synchronised, old-school, score-chasing arcade game that plays like some alien coin-op from another dimension.

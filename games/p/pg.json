It offers only four courses, specifically Quinta do Lago in Portugal, Kungsängen in Sweden, Druids Glen and the K Club in Ireland. Players can choose to play a quick match, a non-tour golf game or participate in the real tour. The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.\n\nParticipation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it's necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour. In order to keep playing there one must not fall out of the top 32 golfers in the rankings.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["Infogrames"],"publishers":["Infogrames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":946598400,"platforms":["Nintendo 64","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co47yj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":43734,"name":"PGA Tour '98","summary":"Go on the links with EA Sports' PGA TOUR '98.

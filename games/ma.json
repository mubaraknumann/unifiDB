New-hire Joe Ferreira was added to train with Peggi as a graphics artist. Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a \"specialty\" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release.

Five people judge levels based on certain criteria, levels are placed into tiers, Wily levels are made by the judges, and everything is compiled into a big game in the end.

The table morphs after each successful shot.\n\nMagic Shot has three different modes to fit your every mood- Meditation, Purity and Insanity. In Meditation mode you will discover a new table at every step along the journey, each named after a city. In the course of 2763 levels, memory and imagination are invoked, linking the table shape with the character of the place name. The aim of Purity mode is to get as high a score as possible. Unlock the ‘Ultra’ phase, accessed by playing perfect shots in a row, and multiply your points while avoiding the decaying table. For Insanity, this is where it gets insane! The table changes continually, the clock's counting down and the pressure is on to get the highest score possible. All players will be able to track their progress on a global Leaderboard. Magic Shot mixes game design and an artistic approach to push the limit between minimalism and entertainment. The unique audio specifically crafted in collaboration with Renaud Bénard using ‘Little bits’, combined with this innovative redesign of classic French Billiards, will surprise you.","genres":["Sport","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Nerial"],"publishers":["Nerial"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1428451200,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hddwkkfetdxyspndkjpg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":327796,"name":"Marvel Rivals: Season 1 - Eternal Night Falls","summary":"Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages.

To do this, the player must deploy energy rigs to rifts on the ocean floor to power their Gateship and summon a Velnai’i fleet to aid them in battle. In addition, the player may use their engineers to build new forward bases for battlefield repairs, or to take control of destroyed enemy installations.\nThe Manta itself is a fighter craft capable of “flight” underwater. When in the air, it uses a targeting system similar to modern fighter jets – using radar lock to target its missiles, and straight aiming for its twin plasma cannons. Battle in the air involves not only dogfights with enemy interceptors, but assaults on massive enemy capital ships.\nUnderwater, however, combat is more of a cat-and-mouse game. The player must use a combination of active and passive sonar to target their enemies. Active sonar gives a better view of the surroundings, but will also reveal the player’s position to enemy submarines.

All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge.

In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution. In Math Classroom Challenge there are two types of mathematical panels with hundreds of math combinations: static and dynamic. The static panels propose random exercises, of configurable difficulty, whose numbers have to be searched through the stage, and bathe them with the water of the hose that we carry. Dynamic panels appear anywhere, but can be repositioned, or even invoked manually, and contain three solutions. Irrigate with water the correct solution.

In normal mode stages unlock sequentially, and each stage has a set vehicle and co-pilot. Upon completing normal mode hard mode stages are unlocked, which have hardier and more aggressive enemies as well as the ability to use all vehicles, pilots, optional gear, and co-pilots in the game. The player can also toggle flight controls between Normal, where the Valkyrie jet mode moves similarly to its bipedal modes, or Real, where the jet can bank and spin like an actual aircraft. In combat Valkyries and the Large Varja units can shift between their different forms by tapping a direction on the right stick. The Queadluun-Rhea does not have alternate forms, but can still change between high speed and maneuverability modes. Units will have a primary weapon (typically a rifle), and a secondary weapon (typically missiles), a melee attack, and speed boost. Weapons have unlimited ammunition, but limited magazines, and must be reloaded when depleted. All units can dash in a direction to break missile locks by double tapping, and shoot down missiles automatically with the missile defense move as long as they have remaining Anti gauge. A Special bar is replenished by gaining sequential hits on targets, and can be expended to increase boost, turn melee into a charging tackle, unleash the vehicle's unique ultimate attack, or activate the co-pilot's special ability. Upon finishing the stage the player is graded on the number of enemies shot down, as well as time and health remaining.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1286409600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa579.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":278200,"name":"Make it!

Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen.

At the start the player chooses one of ten superhero Kamen Riders (Rider 1, Rider 2, Rider V3, Riderman, Rider X, Amazon, Stronger, Super1, Rider 2X or Black RX). The riders are grasshopper-themed altered humans and each come with his own motorcycle rated in three different statistics as well as a unique weapon such as a blade, a hook, a short burst of fire, or a pole. \n \nThe single-player game is only played on the left side of the screen. The middle part shows progress through the level map and the right map the global map of the nine levels. The rider moves forward automatically at a constant speed. The game is fast-paced and the rider needs to dodge obstacles that slow him down, while using a close-ranged melee weapon to take out enemies to earn points or clear the way. There are bottlenecks and large horizontal obstacles such as passing traffic or a shark lying on a beach. Dash patches provide boosts and there are jumps to pass through the air for a few seconds. Both of these provide a permanent speed boost over the default speed and last until there is contact with an obstacle or a surface that slows down the rider. Contact with enemies or obstacles depletes a horizontal fuel meter at the bottom of the left screen. The bottom left corner of the screen holds the speed meter. At the end of each level a score is calculated based on the remaining time and fuel, and a bonus for not missing anything. \n \nThe game supports competitive one-on-one multiplayer where the second player is in the same level using the right side of the screen and can hinder the other player.

Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.\n\nThere are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).\n\nThe single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.\n\nToy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game, however, fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["NOW Production","Namco Bandai Games"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":65.33333333333333,"release_date":1213833600,"platforms":["Wii","Wii U"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2235.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":80240,"name":"Mata Nui Online Game","summary":"A modular Flash point-and-click adventure game developed and updated throughout 2001 by Templar Studios LLC. for the LEGO Group, Mata Nui Online Game (or MNOG) is a game that brought the world of Bionicle to life.","genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Templar Studios"],"publishers":["The LEGO Group"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":978307200,"platforms":["Web browser","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3krq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":78063,"name":"M.A.S.S.

Though the shotgun is Max's weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go.

The Harpoon is also one of Max's favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max's Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies's vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features.\n\nMad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max's garage can also be used to change and modify the car's engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the “shell” of the auto-mobile and the car’s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it's plans hasn't fully been implemented.\n\nMany choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically.

Each probe can link to systems, scan, cut holes in things with a torch, and pick up objects for examination. As the game progresses the probes can be upgraded to give them additional capabilities. They are controlled via an interface that displays the probe's view in a window the center of the screen.

The idea is to blend two genres, Beat’em all Action and RPG, combining character progression, immersion, equipment collection, additional quests and a solid storyline with rhythmic combat sequences, a sense of power from the beginning of the game and of course QTE and bosses with sequential behaviour.\nThis combination leads to a true innovative gameplay supported by many other key features : you can choose between two characters whose different stories intertwine and whose skills vary.\nThe game’s environment has been designed to be an asset in itself, or an important part of the gameplay, with lighting effects which create unprecedented combat situations.\nThe world created for Mars has been designed to offer a true voyage in the heart of a totally new universe mingling decadent futuristic technology and precarious survival on a planet with highly extreme conditions.\nThe storyline leads you to discover your own identity in a web of political intrigue and complex conflicts between forces, allowing you to better understand the world you are travelling. Many scripted sequences give rise to the action and storyline, creating unforgettable moments.\n\n- Combat\nThe combat phases are dynamic and spectacular no matter your level of implication during the quests.\nMost confrontations are brief : you move from one enemy to the other striking or throwing spells one after the\nother. Combat against the bosses or champions lasts longer though, as you must use different tactics to beat them.\nAs you can also modify your environment by breaking part of a roof or moving metal plates to use light as a weapon, the fights gain a more strategic dimension.\nPlaying the role of Pandora is as intense as playing Seth. To make her cast her most powerful spells a precise timing is required as well as constant movement to avoid being interrupted. Even though she is less powerful she is more agile, and just like the warrior needs his weapons, she is nothing without her gauntlets which allow her to canalize her fluid.\nAll enemies, if wounded enough, can be finished off in a spectacular way.\n\n- Two characters : two stories and two forms of gameplay\nMars allows you to choose between two characters with different skills and\nAbilities : Seth, is an elite soldier and highly skilled fighter who tends to act brutally even if athletically. As he progresses in the game he can learn many special attacks and how to master new weapons.\nPandora on the other hand is a technomancer who handles fluids with catalyst gauntlets to produce devastating magic. But more than just using different skills, playing each character results in a different control and gameplay. Their story varies a lot even though it follows a similar course, allowing you to discover two versions of Mars.\n\n- Light effects\nOn Mars sunlight is deadly, which means you can use it during combat to beat your enemies. Seth and Pandora can make gaps in rooftops of different buildings they are fighting on to expose their opponents to sunrays, use mirrors to reflect light on them or push them away from the protection of shady paths.\nYou can modify the architecture of the environment during combat while making sure your character is not exposed to sunrays and watch out for shadows moving position around the sun’s movement. The impact the sun has on the gameplay provides a new feature not only during combat but during the entire game itself.\n\n- A new world\nThe Mars universe is unprecedented, not at all like normal mythological or fantasy worlds, offering a journey in a credible futuristic world where survival and the ability to adapt are keys to be able to withstand a hostile, desperate and decadent environment.

Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Masters of the World simulator for education and training. Over one thousand playable actions.At the country’s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more.\n\nFor each of these areas, numerous laws can be proposed and must be voted on by the Parliament in order to pass. For example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc.\n\nThe player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more.\n\nEvery action has its consequences. Lobbies, social groups, and leading national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence finds it necessary to do so (interviews with the press, resignations, protests, strikes, roadblocks, wars...).\n\nTo prevent tension, the player can meet with any figure, or address the media (over 8 hours of dialog in the game).\n\nThanks to its intelligence services, the player also has an entire arsenal of spies and “special” ops. For example, he or she can - at his or her own risk - reveal scandals about another political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage a foreign infrastructure, have an opponent assassinated, etc.\n\nAs the head of the military, the player can move all of his or her units around the map from their actual bases during military conflicts.\n\nInternational organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council’s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization.Lastly, in order to stay in power, he or she must actively campaign to make sure he or she is elected.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Eversim"],"publishers":["Eversim"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1364256000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cobdrv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":323427,"name":"Magic and Dragon: 4X Battle","summary":"Turn-based strategy game in a world filled with magics, demons and dragons!

The developer of this game is unknown, as the only company shown before the intro screen is Hakuhodo. However, given that Himikogen: Renge was developed by Chime Corporation, it is unlikely that Hakuhodo actually developed Mad Panic Coaster.\n\nIn Mad Panic Coaster, you control a boy and a girl (perhaps a brother and sister?) as they sit in a roller coaster car and go through 15 hellish roller coasters. How these roller coasters even got past safety testing is unknown, as they don't have any rails or barriers of any sort. It's up to you to steer the roller coaster car using the d-pad to make sure it stays on the track. The roller coasters also have various monsters, traps, and jumps to avoid. To do this, you use X to jump. Hitting Square will make the girl throw some sort of yellow ball projectile that explodes at a long range, while hitting Circle will make the boy throw that same type of projectile at a shorter range. Falling off the track or getting hit by something will cost you health, and once you run out, you must start the level all over again.

The gameplay is at least partly inspired by Falcom's Ys series.\n\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.\n\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \"Eight Dog Chronicles\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \"dog\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations.

The objective, as in most of these games, is to have intercourse with several women. The game starts with the player subscribing to a dating agency called \"Man Enough\", run by a woman named Jeri. She assists by popping up on the screen to give hints and evaluate progress. After that, the game goes to a gym where Blair, Erin, Fawn, Kellie and Quinn are. They can be clicked with a cursor in the shape of a human face: it changes to one with a speech balloon when placed over their heads (to initiate dialog and the dating progress), and to one with bulging eyes when placed on their bodies (to play a short \"sexy\" video of the girl).\n\nThe game manual comes with profiles for each girl, listing their predilections and dislikes. Using that information, the player must choose between three answers to each question made. These questions are displayed over a picture of the girl that changes according to her mood. Wrong answers bring sullen looks, and right answers bring broad smiles.\n\nJeri appears regularly to evaluate and encourage the player. Success moves the game forward to another stage, where the whole process is repeated again. Sometimes there is a change of pace with a mini-game (in the case of Quinn, after the second conversation the player has to win on a game of paintball against her).

A nurse is fired if too many babies die on a ward. Keep enough babies alive on your ward for long enough and your nurse moves onto the next ward. Advance through sufficient wards and you get another life (a new trainee is assigned to you). Points are awarded for babies picked up and put into their cots and for medicine bottles picked up. Also, to aid you in your task to save the babies you have a gas button that, when pressed, stops all the babies in their tracks while leaving your nurse free to move around.\n\nThe game has three levels of difficulty.

Pelicans fly in the air from left to right and if they have a fish in their mouth then when hit gives you the fish and you can carry up to eight. Hit a pelican without a fish and it takes one of yours and if you hit one without carrying any then you hit the water and get eaten once again.\n\nOther creatures to avoid are squids, dodos, and storm clouds which release lightning and if you are hit by any then a fish is lost. If you run out of time then a fish is lost but you are given five seconds to try to reach a buoy.

This allows players to get directly on the inside of some of the games that changed the way America viewed baseball.

The game was developed by Maurice Guégan of Stabyourself.net, who has previously worked on parody games such as Not Tetris. Mari0 was developed with the LÖVE framework, and is cross-platform. The game was released on March 3, 2012 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux under a Creative Commons license (BY-NC-SA). The source code is also available to download.\nThe core game of Mari0 plays directly from the 8-bit Super Mario Bros. 2D platform game, where the player controls Mario via the keyboard, running and jumping through levels, avoiding or jumping on enemies to defeat them, while collecting coins to earn points towards their score. The game adds the concept of the \"portal gun\" from the Portal series; the player can click with the mouse device on two separate surfaces on the level to create a portal between them. This can be used for a number of gameplay options, often using vertical momentum entering one portal to \"fling\" the Mario character horizontally out of the other portal, but will also affect enemies and other game elements in similar manners.\nThe core game uses the level designs from the original Super Mario Bros. as well as sets of test chambers inspired by Portal '​s Aperture Science, but a level editor, along with different graphic sets and shaders are provided to create new content. Up to four players can cooperatively play in the game. Online multiplayer is to be released in a future version.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["Stabyourself.net"],"publishers":["Stabyourself.net"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1330732800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22jz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":330716,"name":"Mario for the Masses","summary":"A Mario fangame that didn't get past a demo presentation.","genres":[],"developers":["Nik Jam"],"publishers":["Nik Jam"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":147726,"name":"Maze Breaker 3","summary":"The goal of Maze Breaker 3 is to hit and break all the blocks to clear a level, while avoiding obstacles, and getting the highest score possible.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["nuGame"],"publishers":["nuGame"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1599091200,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5aki.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":144226,"name":"Mainichi","summary":"A short RPG Maker game about a day in the life of developer Mattie Brice.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["Mattie Brice"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1352160000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2uci.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":19198,"name":"Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania","summary":"A stand alone game in the Realm of Majesty 2, extending the original single player game and introducing a new multiplayer mode.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":1291939200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3w0p.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":35679,"name":"MadOut","summary":"Destroy opponents, improve your car and weapons.

Some sections of the location have glimmering lights to indicate a zoomed view available, usually containing one of the missing pieces. The hint button shows the position of one of the hidden pieces, but takes some time to recharge after use.\n\nSome of the pieces can only be obtained after using an inventory tool or solving one of the puzzles. The puzzles take place on a separate screen, where some sort of mechanism has to be manipulated directly to solve it. These mini-games are varied, with logic puzzles about ordering cards, concentration, and other more original challenges.

If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved.

A line of targets will scroll from right to left, bouncing up and down in front of the rifle and the player has to aim at them and shoot. There are 9 different targets which grant the player scores from 1 to 9 points each. When the player reaches 100 points, the targets start to move faster. The game ends when the time reaches 0:00 or when the player runs out of shots (starting with 24).","genres":["Shooter","Tactical"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Philips"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":315446400,"platforms":["Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wz5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":294849,"name":"Mars Assault: 3D Shooter","summary":"Mars Assault offers endless hours of action-packed excitement.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["indiegames3000"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1712620800,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co83yu.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":296750,"name":"Magic Research 2","summary":"Welcome to Magic Research 2, an incremental RPG from the creator of Magic Research.

Edison Carter is an investigative reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic construct of his mind that was stored after Edison was involved in a motorcycle accident and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a \"Max Headroom\" sign going into a tunnel. Max lives in computers and can appear on any screen, television or any electronic device. The character is actually Matt Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear jittery and stuttering like an early computer model.\n\nIn the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 top floors of their high-rise building starting at the 200th floor. Security systems protect each floor and you have to find and enter the correct codes to gain access from the elevators. Each floor seen in isometric view, has lines representing walls of various rooms with doors and office furniture. Robots will chase and fire at you and decrease your health level as shown on the biomonitor at bottom of screen. Also indicated are the floor number and time left. On the right side of screen are 4 icons for Reporter E. Carter which open a door, call elevator, view through camera, or allow movement to run around the floor. On the left side are icons for Controller T.

The game also uses simple tile-based movement, where the player moves from square to square. Other players are seen as eyeballs. When a player sees another player, they can shoot or otherwise negatively affect them. Players gain points for shooting other players, and lose them for being shot. Some versions (like the X11 port) had a cheat mode where the player running the server could see the other players' positions on the map.

[{"igdb_id":47217,"name":"F40 Pursuit Simulator","summary":"You have discovered evidence that a rogue group of police officers are involved in a stolen car racket To stop them profiting form their dubious actions you must get across America as quickly as possible. This is made a little easier by the fact that your turbocharged Ferrari F40 can do over 300 MPH. \n \nThere are many forks in the road, with arrows at the top of the screen indicating which route is quicker. Any high-speed contact causes the car to blow up, but you have an infinite supply of these, and the only real penalty is the lost time. There are lots of road blocks to swerve around. The police are after you - pay attention to the sirens and stay out of their way.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":602380800,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"35371503","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/F40%20Pursuit%20Simulator"}]},{"igdb_id":253358,"name":"F-4 Phantom II: Sky Defender","summary":null,"genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1677974400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6mio.jpg","external_ids":[]}]

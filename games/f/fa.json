It resembles its predecessor, Shin Onigashima, in its implementation of the \"Change Character\" command, usage of traditional Japanese fairytales, and general screen layout and appearance. The story-line is a parody of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, where two main characters, Goku and Chao, embark upon separate journeys to find one another.\n\nIn Yuuyuki, the \"Change Character\" command can switch between a maximum of five different characters. However, there are very few points in the game where it can actually be used to such extent. Its main use is to switch between Goku and the others accompanying him. Like Shin Onigashima, the character in use can greatly affect the descriptive text shown on screen, and the significant increase in number of characters allowed for more variety in each scene. It is possible to enjoy the game by viewing the reactions towards choosing completely unrelated characters or commands in certain situations.\n\nWhile Shin Onigashima demanded rather complex puzzle-solving abilities, Yuuyuki mainly focuses on having the player carefully read and understand the story-line. Puzzles are solved easily in this game, and very few choices actually lead to a \"game over\" screen. Easy trivia questions and simple action gameplay emerge at certain points, and players may find themselves searching for the obvious answer on screen more often than thinking hard to solve the puzzle at hand.\n\nMain changes in gameplay from Shin Onigashima include the implementation of the \"Ittaisan\" command, which saves progress at any point during the game, and faster animation of game text. The shortening in load time after choosing commands, and an overall decrease in difficulty allowed Yuuyuki to run at a much quicker tempo than its predecessor.","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Pax Softonica","Nintendo R&D4"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":627004800,"platforms":["Family Computer Disk System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co38wx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":344098,"name":"Falcon Lander","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1747612800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9tqd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":47249,"name":"Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shoujo - Kouhen","summary":"As a young detective (whom you name yourself), you work as an assistant for the famous investigator Utsugi.

It resembles its predecessor, Shin Onigashima, in its implementation of the \"Change Character\" command, usage of traditional Japanese fairytales, and general screen layout and appearance. The story-line is a parody of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, where two main characters, Goku and Chao, embark upon separate journeys to find one another.\n\nIn Yuuyuki, the \"Change Character\" command can switch between a maximum of five different characters. However, there are very few points in the game where it can actually be used to such extent. Its main use is to switch between Goku and the others accompanying him. Like Shin Onigashima, the character in use can greatly affect the descriptive text shown on screen, and the significant increase in number of characters allowed for more variety in each scene. It is possible to enjoy the game by viewing the reactions towards choosing completely unrelated characters or commands in certain situations.\n\nWhile Shin Onigashima demanded rather complex puzzle-solving abilities, Yuuyuki mainly focuses on having the player carefully read and understand the story-line. Puzzles are solved easily in this game, and very few choices actually lead to a \"game over\" screen. Easy trivia questions and simple action gameplay emerge at certain points, and players may find themselves searching for the obvious answer on screen more often than thinking hard to solve the puzzle at hand.\n\nMain changes in gameplay from Shin Onigashima include the implementation of the \"Ittaisan\" command, which saves progress at any point during the game, and faster animation of game text. The shortening in load time after choosing commands, and an overall decrease in difficulty allowed Yuuyuki to run at a much quicker tempo than its predecessor.","genres":["Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Nintendo"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":624326400,"platforms":["Family Computer Disk System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co44kn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":118709,"name":"Far Cry 5: Digital Deluxe Edition","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":381629,"name":"Family Reunion","summary":"Family Reunion is a game about speedrunning a childhood family dinner.

The game is divided in three main sections. The first is a hidden object challenge with a time limit, where the player has to search for objects on rooms from the house, to sell them later. Instead of the usual list at the side of the screen with names of required items, the game shows slots to store a general type of object, and the player has to click on things that correspond to the category or theme (for example, \"Babies and Kids\" for toys, \"Yard and Garden\" for gardening tools, and so on). Some objects need an extra item to make them work, like power chords and batteries, before they can be collected. Next comes the yard sale, shown in a isometric view, with all the items set on tables and the customers roaming around them. A list at the left side shows clues to what every patron wants (\"woman in red wants to cart some rocks\"). The player has to drag and drop the customers to their items. The final component is the decoration screen, where the money accumulated on the yard sale is spent on curtains, floor covers, furniture and other things.

It resembles its predecessor, Shin Onigashima, in its implementation of the \"Change Character\" command, usage of traditional Japanese fairytales, and general screen layout and appearance. The story-line is a parody of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, where two main characters, Goku and Chao, embark upon separate journeys to find one another.\n\nIn Yuuyuki, the \"Change Character\" command can switch between a maximum of five different characters. However, there are very few points in the game where it can actually be used to such extent. Its main use is to switch between Goku and the others accompanying him. Like Shin Onigashima, the character in use can greatly affect the descriptive text shown on screen, and the significant increase in number of characters allowed for more variety in each scene. It is possible to enjoy the game by viewing the reactions towards choosing completely unrelated characters or commands in certain situations.\n\nWhile Shin Onigashima demanded rather complex puzzle-solving abilities, Yuuyuki mainly focuses on having the player carefully read and understand the story-line. Puzzles are solved easily in this game, and very few choices actually lead to a \"game over\" screen. Easy trivia questions and simple action gameplay emerge at certain points, and players may find themselves searching for the obvious answer on screen more often than thinking hard to solve the puzzle at hand.\n\nMain changes in gameplay from Shin Onigashima include the implementation of the \"Ittaisan\" command, which saves progress at any point during the game, and faster animation of game text. The shortening in load time after choosing commands, and an overall decrease in difficulty allowed Yuuyuki to run at a much quicker tempo than its predecessor.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Pax Softonica","Nintendo R&D4"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":624326400,"platforms":["Family Computer Disk System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co38ww.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":342396,"name":"Fantasy RPG: Raid Legends","summary":"Step Into a World of Adventure—Your Legend Begins Now.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1745971200,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9x5g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":355804,"name":"Favela Kick: The Final Goal","summary":"From favela streets to global superstardom!

In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive.\n\nIn order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons.\n\n“You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today.\nThe wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?”\n\nFade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Black Forest Games"],"publishers":["THQ Nordic"],"aggregated_rating":42.0,"release_date":1525046400,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27q9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":191903,"name":"Fallen London: A Stretch in the Sky","summary":"A Stretch in the Sky is add-on for Fallen London, a browser-based choose-your-own-adventure game set in \"Fallen London\", an alternative Victorian London with gothic overtones.

The fifth main entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa.\n\nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Nintendo SPD","Koei Tecmo Games"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":60.77777777777778,"release_date":1411776000,"platforms":["Wii U"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zcv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":359635,"name":"Factory Life","summary":"Experience life in an electronics factory under your boss's pressure and growing demands!

It is a Fable in one way, but in the 'trick of the tale', it's a strange adventure through a shattered world and a saga born out of the very sick mind of a man called Ismael.\n\nLong ago in the mists of time lived the Mecubarz. Ancient and beautiful, powerful and wise they ruled absolute. Strange beings, magical creatures and humans lived together in peace and harmony, until greed destroyed it all. Ismael, a respected man, and revered by all, sadly had a heart that was hollow and bitter. He and four others plotted to overthrow the Mecubarz.\n\nThe Mecubarz' fury at the treason of Ismael and his men was cataclysmic. They trapped the four seasons and put them into impenetrable crystals, casting them to the four corners of the shattered world where they stood still and were held in an eternal dominion of ice, mist, water, and fire. The four traitors were exiled, but Ismael disappeared.\n\nAs Quickthorpe, an inexperienced adventurer, your quest is to explore the Four Lands of the Mecubarz in search of the mystical gems that will liberate your people. Keen observation, puzzle-solving skill and quick thinking are the abilities required to undertake this exciting but unpredictable task. Interact with a universe of characters which come to life with true speech creating a world with an atmosphere so thick you can feel it. Combined stunning animations and atmospheric sound effects will ensure that Fable will take you on the journey of a lifetime!\n\nBut beware... in the world of Fable not everything is as it seems.","genres":["Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Simbiosis Interactive"],"publishers":["Telstar Electronic Studios Ltd.","Sir-tech Software"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":851990400,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26iz.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"UCivh45sRPNwAEZb20vudSng","url":"https://gaming.youtube.com/game/UCivh45sRPNwAEZb20vudSng"},{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"23561","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-23561/"}]},{"igdb_id":133741,"name":"Fantasy of Alice","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":116406,"name":"Fashion AR","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["FortuneFish"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":191735,"name":"Fallen London: Shades of Yesterday","summary":"An addon for Fallen London.

The game would have featured fourteen new weapons and ten new enemies. Depending on whether the player is good or evil, the game would have played out differently. Each of the four characters that were playable would have had a different fighting style, therefore each time the player played the game, they would have a different experience. It would have had two player co-op action for players to experience the game with their friends. The Dark Alliance Engine would have been fleshed out and player experience would have been refined. A brand new sneak system would have been added to the game. This system would have allowed players to stealthily follow enemies or use a sniper rifle on them. For characters that could not use the sniper rifle, Interplay added a turret mode allowing those characters to use turrets.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Interplay Entertainment"],"publishers":["Interplay Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5z84.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":205113,"name":"Fantastic Fetus: Prebirth","summary":"Fantastic Fetus is a pregnancy simulator, where you are taking care of a pregnant woman and create your dream fetus.

Demons joined both forces in this great battle. Finally, Huangdi got the upper hand and became the emperor of China. Shortly before his death, he decided to reincarnate as a mortal many years later, so he came to the border of paradise, and spoke with the dragon demon Yinglong, who was supporting his rival before, as well as other demons. Yinglong descended upon the Earth, and his body parts turned into powerful weapons and artifacts - his claw became a sword, his eye a pearl, and his heart took the shape of a seal. The legends say that if someone can get one of the three artifacts, he can once again wield the power in the whole China.\n\nFast-forward to 196 AD. It is the time of Eastern Han dynasty, the end of one of the several golden epochs of the Chinese civilization. Two gods, Yunkong and Daotian, are playing chess with each other to decide the fate of China. In the village Zhaode live two young noblemen, Chu Ge and his best friend Han Jing, as well as his beloved one Shen Yan. They live a normal life and wish to move to the capital and to find good jobs there. But an accident makes them meet their true destiny...\n\nThe second Huanxiang Sanguozhi game takes us to the time period that preceeded the Three Kingdoms era by about a hundred years. Once again, the game deals with concrete historical events and characters, but adds many fictional elements to them, mostly of supernatural character. The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game. You control a party of heroes and fight enemies in turn-based or active-time combat (you can choose the type of combat since the beginning). The game features pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D cut scenes. It also allows you to choose between three difficulty levels.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["UserJoy Entertainment"],"publishers":["Unistar","Nihon Falcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1122681600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5nrw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":192017,"name":"Facility 386","summary":"Facility 386 is a horror game where you have to use your hearing to survive.

In addition to navigating the main characters around the mansion grounds, players are able to enter Viewfinder Mode, where the camera is raised and the view changes to that of the camera's frame. In viewfinder mode the player is able to snap photographs of ghosts, both violent and benign, which is the main method of progressing through the game. Items are also available, some being consumable and most being key items needed to unlock doors, complete tasks or solve puzzles. Puzzles are encountered frequently in the game, some being based on the same concept but becoming progressively more difficult. The varying difficulty settings of the game (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Fatal (Xbox only)) determine the amount of consumable items scattered throughout the mansion and how formidable the enemies are.\n\nThe main horror aspect of the game is, undoubtedly, the ghosts. The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player. The ghosts' appearances are usually inspired by their deaths or by Japanese stigmas of horror, which, some argue, are particularily chilling.\n\nThe game, depending on which console it is played on, offers two endings. Upon completion of the game, a ranking is given based on total time taken, points accumulated and other categories. The player is also given rewards and unlockables, such as alternate costumes and camera functions, depending on what difficulty was beaten, how much of the Ghost List was completed and other criteria. Beating the game also unlocks Battle Mode, where the player is faced with fighting specific ghosts, and is rewarded with points towards purchasing unlockables. An option is also given where the game can be replayed with all equipment, upgrades and unlockables carried over.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Tecmo"],"publishers":["Wanadoo Edition","Tecmo"],"aggregated_rating":80.5,"release_date":1008201600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9jki.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"18070","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18070/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"16570","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fatal Frame"}]},{"igdb_id":41287,"name":"Family Composer","summary":"Family Composer was developed by Musical Plan for the Family Computer Disk System and published by Tokyo Shoseki in 1987.

It is the first Family Feud video game to be released on Xbox 360 and the third to be developed on Wii by Ludia Inc.\n\nIn Family Feud, one hundred people were surveyed and gave answers to various questions. Two families then battle each other by trying to guess the top answers to each question. In each round, a member of each family is asked to join the host on the center of the stage to answer one question. The quickest player to buzz in gets to answer first. If he/she doesn't give the number one answer, the other player can give his/her answer as well. Whoever has the best answer will then decide to either \"play\" or \"pass\". If the player decides to play, his/her family will have to guess all the answers to win the round. If the player decides to pass, the opposing family will have to find all the answers.\n\nEach wrong answer results in a strike. After three strikes, the other family has a chance to steal the points. To do so, they must find one correct answer that hasn't already been given. When all the rounds are over, the family with the most points gets to play \"fast money\". In \"fast money\", the player is asked to answer the five same questions twice (or in multiplayer mode, two players can each answer the set of five questions). If the player gets 200 points or more in the \"fast money\" round, he/she wins $20 000!\n\nFamily Feud: 2012 Edition includes over 2000 survey questions, three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), a party mode with up to 4 players, bonus videos featuring Steve Harvey and lets the player play as his/her avatar on Xbox 360 or Mii on Wii.\n\nIn challenge mode, 1 to 4 players can play cooperatively against 16 different families. Each family has its own themed alcove (a beach, a mansion, a spaceship, a prehistoric den, a haunted house, a private boat, a bowling alley, etc). In party mode, 2 to 4 players can compete against each other.\n\nKinect features were developed for the game on Xbox 360, but were eventually dropped as they didn't add any fun factor to the game.

There are also a number of secret areas in the castle that are not visually obvious to the player and can only be discovered through exploration.\n\nDuring Isvar's exploration of the castle he is accosted by its guards and monsters - trolls, monks, guards, tornadoes, man-eating plants, bubbles, etc. all of which weaken Isvar's energy. The castle also contains food and magical potions which will restore his health. In addition, certain game objects can affect the enemies, (by either killing them, distracting them, or freezing them, depending on the object and the type of enemy they are used upon)\n\nOnce defeated in combat a guard disappears leaving only his helmet behind. Helmets can be picked up and carried by Isvar, and placed somewhere else out of harms way (or into the path of a tornado, that destroys any object it touches). If Isvar leaves the room, the guard will regenerate from the helmet.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["The Edge"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Amstrad CPC","Amstrad PCW"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6884.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":202910,"name":"Fantasy Zone Neo Classic","summary":"A remaster of the NES port of Fantasy Zone.

Well, this is Fat Rat Pinball, a nice casual game free to play!

But don't panic - no animals are hurt in this game. Everything happens in a nice way.\n\nAs a casual game, you can try to beat up one of the pinball tables in about ten minutes. Some pinball machines have stages, as a kind of runner, and you go up until the end point. So, it's part of the game challenge to win the tables, but you'll need to be skilled to do it.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: one touch in the right or left screen side and you'll activate the respective flipper. For launching the ball, you should touch the screen and slide down to choose the spring force. It's possible to play with one finger - one hand game - but we recommend using both hands for more speed on activating the paddles.\n\nFat Rat Pinball uses a reward system, and you can earn rubies while playing. Completing a pinball table a couple of times will make you earn rubies enough to release new content inside the game. There are rewarded Ads after the matches and you can choose if you want to watch them or not - you are not forced to see any Ad while playing.\n\nUsing your rubies can release new characters and tables for playing.

The player takes control of the character known as Courier 6, who, preceding the start of the game, is hired by a delivery service called the Mojave Express to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip. The game starts during the delivery, where the Courier is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package.

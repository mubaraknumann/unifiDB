Known for its setting where girls engage in deadly battles, high playability, and well-crafted background music.\n\nCharacters gain experience points through combat to acquire new skills. The game employs a multi-scenario system where outcomes vary based on strategic decisions and choices made during battles. Although criticized for modest production values, an abrupt mid-story ending, and a simplistic growth system resembling a prototype version, it featured diverse elements typical of doujinshi, such as variations in character dialogue and designs, and occasional single-image cut-ins. Notably, the game manual was integrated within the game rather than being a separate paper format. A commercialized version released as \"Metajo\" was released a year later with many mechanic and graphic improvements as well as story alterations such as allowing players to experience the 1200-year establishment until the end.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Indie"],"developers":["R-Force Software"],"publishers":["R-Force Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":796608000,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8i3m.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"817041843","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Furitsu%20Metatopology%20Daigaku%20Fuzoku%20Joshi%20Koukou"}]},{"igdb_id":309359,"name":"Fushigi na Sekai no Kankou Nikki","summary":"This game is finding them and trying to clear the game.

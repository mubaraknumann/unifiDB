The controls in the original coin-op version consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the \"roll switch\".Rotating the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the character to perform a \"megacrush\" attack will destroy all on-screen enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge.\n\nThe player character is accompanied by a satellite module orbiting near him that will provide backup firepower every time the player fires their gun. Like the main character, the satellite can also be rotated with the roll switch. Rotating the character while firing will only rotate the aim of the satellite, while rotating the character without firing will not only rotate the satellite's aim, it will also move its relative position around the player.\n\nThe player can obtain blue-colored coins known as \"zennies\" from defeating enemies throughout the game. The zennies are used as currency to obtain new power-up items from shops located at certain points in each stage. When the player enters an item shop, they are given a choice of the items available and a limited time to make any purchase they wish. These items consists primarily of new weapons for the satellite module, but also includes a health kit to restore lost vitality, an armor that allows the player to sustain additional damage, and even tips on how to defeat the boss awaiting at the end of the current stage.\n\nForgotten Worlds consists of five stages with a total of eight bosses. The player will lose if their vitality gauge runs out, but will be given a chance to continue.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom","Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom","NEC Avenue, Ltd.","Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","U.S. Gold","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":599529600,"platforms":["Arcade","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Wii","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Atari ST/STE","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","DOS","Amiga","Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD","Amstrad CPC","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26j3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"13053","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Forgotten Worlds"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"14220","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-14220/"}]},{"igdb_id":7307,"name":"Folklore","summary":"The vision of legendary game creator Yoshiki Okamoto (executive producer for Onimusha, Devil May Cry and Resident Evil), Folklore is a brand new action adventure title for PS3.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Game Republic Inc."],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":77.0,"release_date":1182384000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob94f.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"7586","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-7586/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6947","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Folklore"}]},{"igdb_id":7326,"name":"Forza Horizon 2","summary":"Race through a massive wide-open world featuring dramatic weather and day-to-night cycle in Forza Horizon 2.

While combat works similar as in Astonishia Story, there are a lot of surprising WRPG influences. In the beginning the main character's class is determined by a catalog of questions, just like in many Ultima games. Then three companions are picked from a variety of classes and typical fantasy races (Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits). Two more slots are available for more characters to join temporarily, or even replace some of the original companions for good.\n\nThe game is much more nonlineal and open ended than most Far Eastern RPGs, every town holds a variety of sidequests, which often rely on character's classes or the party's reputation, which is raised by doing good deeds. On the other hand the game punishes what the writer deemed immoral behavious, taking inspiration once again from Ultima. For a good portion of the game there isn't even a real \"main story\" to follow, that only unfolds after solving many individual tasks. Player decisions often have a deep impact on the outcome of a quest. At one point, for example, the party gets caught by a dragon, but manages to escape, alongside many other prisoners. If the heroes then chose to chase and kill the dragon for its treasure instead of fleeing directly, the dragon escapes, killing all fleeing prisoners on the way. The game is also full of little touches, most notable the party doesn't follow the leader in a straight line like in most JRPGs, but in a losely tied bunch of individuals.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Sonnori"],"publishers":["Phantagram"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":878342400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xhk.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"2142017638","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Forgotten%20Saga"}]},{"igdb_id":145753,"name":"FoxInTheBox","summary":"FoxInTheBox is a small platform for cyber security, teaching methods of ethical hacking and creating challenges to solve.","genres":["Puzzle","Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1618012800,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xt9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146067,"name":"FOnline: Ashes of Phoenix","summary":"FOnline: Ashes of Phoenix is a Fallout MMORPG based on the FOnline engine.

You receive scores at the end of the game based on how many treasures you collect, how many gems you find, and how many times you die in the game. The main objective of the game is to escape the fortress! There is no save functionality, but you can lock your Playdate and start where you left off later on.

The player's objective is to rid the galaxy of a dreaded alien called Zorlac. Zorlac is positioned on the right side of the screen and is protected by a fortress consisting of three rotating walls as well as four indestructible stationary guns. The player starts out at the left edge of the screen but can move around in all directions. To be able to hit the alien the player first has to blast a hole through the three walls. It is made harder by the constant movements of both the rotating walls and the alien. At the same time the player has to avoid being hit by the defense guns which automatically lock in on the player ship. As the game goes on the fortress slowly moves toward the player who gets less space to dodge the enemy fire.\n\nOnce the player has been able to hit Zorloc, he gets enraged and the game moves on to the next level that's played at a higher speed. The player scores points by destroying the walls of the fortress and for hitting the alien. Points are awarded based on the skill level chosen before a game and the player's distance from the edge of the screen. Hitting the alien is worth fifty times more than destroying a block in the fortress. The player has access to five ships and once they have all been destroyed the game ends.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Timex Computer Corporation","Softsync"],"publishers":["Timex Computer Corporation","Softsync"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Sinclair ZX81"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8xgo.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1957859819","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fortress%20of%20Zorlac"}]},{"igdb_id":319631,"name":"Forgotten Memories: Remastered Edition","summary":"A new Forgotten Memories: Remastered Edition is coming!

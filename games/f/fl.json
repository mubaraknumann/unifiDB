Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well.

Flyff is a fairly typical party-oriented grinding game where no character can do everything; efficient play requires working in groups to level up by killing monsters, or Masquerpets. Its main distinctiveness lies in its flying system: flying is the normal method of transportation for characters above level 20.\n\nFlyff is hosted in 13 countries and 10 languages and is played by over 30 million people.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nPlayers control an avatar that spends most of its active time fighting and most of its inactive time running a shop. Character classes are chosen at level 15 and sub-classes at levels 60 and 130, referred to as the first, second, and third job changes. The job changes are obligatory—when a character reaches the requisite level, experience gain stops until the completion of one of the job quests. At level 120, the character can become a Master, returning to level 60 with enhanced powers and able to work its way back up to level 121 and become a Hero. As of version 17, Heroes may select a third job class at level 130 and level up to the current cap of 150.\n\nLevels are gained based on experience, which can be acquired by killing Masquerpets and by performing quests. Quests generally involve killing specific Masquerpets and collecting the different quest objects they drop; a typical early quest is that of \"Party of Is,\" with the requirement of collecting 7 Chupims through killing Pukepukes.\n\nAt each level, the character receives skill points that can be invested in skills available to its job(s). There are two types of skills: those used for attacking and those used for protection and/or enhancement. Skills may have cool-down times and may cause status effects, with confusion, stun, and bleed among the most common effect. It is not possible to acquire maximum levels in all available skills until becoming a level 60 Master.\n\nCharacters can be improved by acquiring objects such as improved equipment. Masquerpets drop equipment, the in-game currency penya, consumable items such as food and potions, and quest objects, or players can purchase equipment from other players note this is usually extremely expensive because of the high quality gear that can be acquired this way. These can all be traded between players; Flyff gameplay involves large amounts of buying and selling in order to collect desired equipment. Most equipment items have minimum levels at which they can be used.\n\nCombat\nFlyff features melee, ranged and magic combat, with different skills available to different classes. Health points, fight points, and magic power bars are able to be replenished through food, vital drinks and mana refreshers; some classes depend on assists to heal them with magic.\n\nPvP\nPlayer versus player (PvP) combat is allowed on all servers without penalty in the form of dueling. Both players must be over level 15, and within 30 levels of each other, then they must confirm the duel first unless they are within the PvP Arena, a free-for-all environment found on all servers. Player killing is allowed only on the Yetti server and carries a high penalty.\n\nSOCIAL SYSTEMS:\nLord System\nIntroduced in version 12, the Lord system allows eligible players to be voted as the Lord of their server for 2 weeks. Players must have obtained Hero or Master status to qualify as a Lord candidate. While a Lord, a player may introduce a number of events on the server. Lords are taxed between 0 to 20% on all NPC purchases and returns and are given a portion of all player taxes. 10% of eligible voters must participate in the Lord vote for a Lord to be chosen. To vote for a candidate, a player must be at least level 60 and must have logged in to the game within the last 30 days. Each player may only vote for one candidate per election.\n\nParty System\nPlayers who join a party gain increased experience and loot. A lone player does not benefit from or harm a party. A party starts as a Regular Party, in which experience is distributed evenly among party members in the same location. At level 10, the party becomes Advanced, at which point experience can be distributed to players based on their amount of damage done. An Advanced Party may have up to 8 players; having this many players in a party increases player experience with each monster killed during training.\n\nGuild System\nGuilds allow players to socialize; players within a guild can chat with each other and many in-game activities are guild-based. Guilds have a hierarchical chain of command, consisting of the Master/Leader, Kingpins, Captains, Supporters, and Rookies. The guild master may change the permissions for guild members, allowing members to withdraw items or money from the guild bank, rank-up or de-rank other members, and be paid daily. Guilds are able to choose an emblem and cloak to represent themselves and have the use of a warehouse. When a guild reaches the appropriate guild level, increased by supporting the guild through quest items and Penya, the guild master may create guild cloaks at a cost that sport the guild's symbol. A large amount of Flyff end-game content is guild-related.\n\nGuild Siege\nThis event, held on Saturday in channel 1 of each server, allows guilds to compete in a free-for-all environment. A total of 8 Guilds may enter, and each Guild may have 10 players. To compete, the Guild leader must place a bid; the 8 highest bidders compete.\n\nClockworks War\nThe Clockworks War is a guild dungeon that guilds of any level may enter a single time. If the guild fails against the dungeon boss, its players may reattempt to win as many times as necessary for a time period of one hour. Only one guild is permitted inside the Clockworks Arena at a time.\n\nCouple System\nThe couple system, implemented in Version 13, allows a marriage-style connection between two characters. Characters who become a couple are granted special buffs and skills and receive gifts with new couple level gained.\n\nMentor/Pupil System\nThe Mentor/Pupil system, implemented in Version 15, allows any player level 91 or above to take on any character who has not completed their second Job Change as a pupil after completing the mentor qualification quest. This Mentor/Pupil bond provides a special bonus to experience gained by both mentor and pupil while both characters are logged on to the same server. Additionally, upon the pupil reaching certain level marks, the mentor gains 'Mentor Points'; as the mentor gains more of these points, additional pupils may be taken on, to a maximum of 3 pupils when over 100 Mentor Points are gained. These additional pupils grant increases to the experience bonus of the mentor; the other pupils' experience bonus' remain unchanged.\n\nWhile no action apart from the initial bonding is necessary within the Mentor/Pupil relationship, mentors are encouraged to help their pupils with advice, quests, and/or occasional gifts. If at any time either pupil or mentor becomes dissatisfied, the player may cancel the bond. The Mentor Points of a mentor who loses all pupils returns to 0 and must be regained through new Mentor/Pupil bonds.\n\nOTHER GAME SYSTEMS:\nEvents\nEvents involving rare drops and extra experience are held almost every week by the gamemaster team. Maintenance is held every Tuesday evening (gPotato) and Thursday noon (FlyFF PH).\n\nCollector System\nRe-Introduced in version 11, the Collector System allows players to collect rare and unique game items through the use of a Collectors.\n\nPrivate Shops\nPlayers can open private shops, in which held items can be sold at any price. Other players can enter these shops and purchase the items within, with the purchase money transferred to the shop owner's inventory.\n\nRaising Pets\nPlayers may keep seven types of Raised Pets, which start out as eggs that may be dropped by any Masquerpet level 20 and above. An egg can be hatched by the Pet Tamer NPC after feeding the egg 50,000 pet feed. To evolve a pet, players must complete quests given by the Pet Tamer. Pets must also be fed to keep them alive. Each Raised Pet has five levels and three appearances. A player accompanied by a pet receives additional stat points based on the type of pet.\n\nElements\nMonsters are generally associated with a particular in-game elements, of which there are five. Each element is vulnerable to one element and resistant to another. Weapons and armor can be \"elemented\", conferring advantages against monsters of some types and disadvantages against others; many aggressive spells are also elemented.\n\nCash Shop\nFlyff uses a micropayment system through which users can obtain 'Game Cash'. Game Cash can be exchanged for premium items not otherwise available in the game, including clothing, potions, different kinds of scrolls and pick-up pets.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nIn December 2002, Aeonsoft developed the first provisional prototype of the game, called Clockworks Ltd. In September 2003, the company changed the game's name to Flyff, and began its first closed beta in Korea. In July 2004, it won the Game of the Month award from the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Over the next year, it was launched in three more countries: China, Taiwan, and Thailand. In October 2005, the US received the closed beta, which ran for a month before Flyff was commercially launched in December.\n\nTECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT:\nGame mechanics\nAeonsoft employs its own in-house core technology. The world object engine uses load balancing middle-ware, multi-thread and parallel game logic processing. The 3D flying engine uses faster process with vector and collide mesh and 3D space divided by Octree System. Its network sync engine utilities packet optimization by object move estimation, client-side sync calculation, and object move calibration processes.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Gala Lab Corp.","Aeonsoft"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1135468800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3xug.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":339797,"name":"Flooded Burials","summary":"Flooded Burials is a top-down action adventure game about exploring a tower buried in the sea.

However, therapy using mentally invasive devices is a ripe subject of controversy in the 2030s and seems to have more risks than benefits.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Rindre"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1489190400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7kb3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":58580,"name":"Flashing Lights: Police Fire EMS","summary":"Flashing Lights is a multiplayer emergency services simulator focusing on firefighters, police and emergency medical services.","genres":["Simulator","Indie"],"developers":["Nils Jakrins"],"publishers":["Excalibur Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1528329600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co24dw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":55801,"name":"Floor Plan: Hands-On Edition","summary":"Floor Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator.

Game is currently in early development with set goals.\n\n* PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD - You will play a robot as the main protagonist of Floatlands, going up against other robots. Game world will consist of several biomes: jungle, desert, sea and snow. These worlds will be unique all the time because they will be randomly generated. Islands and natural elements will have certain similarities, but altogether the world will be unique every time.\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scorched-sunset-lowpoly-floatlands.png\n\n* QUESTING, POINTS OF INTEREST - There will be random events/quests (defending, collecting, exploring) across the world for you to complete. Quests, missions will also be randomly generated in order to bring the unpredictability aspect to the game.\n\nhttps://i0.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/quest-character-lowpoly-floatlands-2.png\n\n* PLAYING STYLES - You can choose different play styles when playing in the world of Floatlands. You can be an explorer or you can be an aggressive player that wants to eliminate threats of well being.\n\n* RESOURCE GATHERING - Important part will be the resource gathering aspect. Some basics: Shooting down robot enemies will provide you scrap metal; by chopping trees you will gain wood; sheep is a source for wool; you will also find resources in caves. Certain materials need to be processed and smelted in order to be used for building structures.\n\n* CUSTOM BUILD MODE - With gathered resources you’ll be able to build and upgrade your own custom base/shelter and defend from enemies. At this moment there are 50 different build parts you can use to build your base. There are also 3 tiers – wood (starting tier), stone and fortified stone (highest tier for now). Build mode mixed with random generated terrain provides a multitude of options (basic shacks, castles…), so it will be interesting in this regard.\n\n* ELECTRIC SYSTEM - One other major feature in game is electricity which will provide you with different options in the game - repairing your robot, powering up the lights and your defense system (turrets). We are in the process of making various props that will need a source of energy. Generators will be that source and with cables you'll have the option to connect devices yourself. You will have to fill generators with fuel to get them to work.\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/electricity_connection_lowpoly_floatlands.png","genres":["Fighting","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Studio Techtrics"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ouaxx1g0bmqrfg6lcfyo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":85143,"name":"Flashback: 25th Anniversary - Collector's Edition","summary":"To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Super Nintendo version of game, Microïds is releasing a Collector's Edition (in Europe and Australia), which includes the game in physical edition, a retro cartridge style metal case, an exclusive numbered metal card, a 24-page retro-style instruction booklet, the digital soundtrack (remastered version).

You can set a number of options such as the number of pieces and whether the animation randomly plays back and forth or just in one direction. There are also four different modes of play for single or multi player, in this case more like party play. The animations vary from optical illusions to simple CG.\n\nThe object of the game is to place all the rectangular pieces into the correct positions. Puzzle pieces can be varied in size to as few as 2x2 to over 10x10, depending on the puzzle. Additional options to increase difficulty include mirrored or flipped pieces, locking correctly placed pieces, blanking placed pieces after a time delay, and occasionally playing the video clip in reverse.\n\nThere are four game modes in FlixMix. In Single Mingle, the player has unlimited time to solve a single puzzle. In Scramblecade, the player rotates through all the puzzles in a tileset, with the pieces shrinking in size almost each round. The player has a time limit, which can be extended by placing pieces, placing pieces in bonus spaces worth extra time and points, and solving puzzles. In Joint Venture, up to nine players take turns solving a sequence of puzzles with the winner being the one to solve the most puzzles within a time limit.

Tackle problems and defeat enemies to reveal magical Rainbow Drops, each of which will restore some of Aquaticus' power and allow it to open more chapters and grant you new powers.

One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.","genres":["Fighting","Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Culture Brain"],"publishers":["Culture Brain"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":540259200,"platforms":["Family Computer","Wii U","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6nvy.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":328417,"name":"Floria","summary":"A beautiful Match-3 game with some strategy.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["LGT SIA"],"publishers":["LGT SIA"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1732838400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9aho.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":95260,"name":"FlickSync - Mad Hatter VR","summary":"Players can take on the role of Alice, the March Hare, or the Mad Hatter in an Alice in Wonderland themed Flicksync experience. **This game requires a microphone to play**","genres":["Simulator","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1522368000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":41751,"name":"Flight Simulator With Torpedo Attack","summary":"Climb into the pilot's seat of your Nakajima Tenzan torpedo/bomber airplane and head for the skies!

The Pterodactyl of Joust also makes an appearance in FlapPing, adding an unpredictable element to the gameplay!\n\nFlapPing is descended from JoustPong, the name Kirk Israel originally chose for his original homebrew game.

The sole purpose for this organization’s existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means helping the current Prime Minister keep ahead of his competition in the polls.\n\nFloor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister's polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or even the player's continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.\n\nDuring the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film \"Capricorn One\"). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.\n\nThe Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting people’s homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it's doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these \"black hat\" activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain \"Mr. Garcia\" (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/figk1uwjdgeffl4kiiio.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":92065,"name":"Fluid","summary":"A unique Interactive Sound Lab that enables you to compose infinite music sequences covering all genres of dance music.

This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more. \n \nYou must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you. \n \nHowever, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self. \n \nThere are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going. \n \nThe bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that’s not all, as some enemies can’t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out. \n \nEnemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes. The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils. \n \nAs this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness. \n \nFloating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve. \n \nThe final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better. \n \nSeems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in. \n \nThat's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity. \n \nThis description was compiled from the following reviews: \n \nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review \n \nhttp://www.pspminis.com/8859/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here/","genres":["Shooter","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Dakko Dakko"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":1334707200,"platforms":["PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2nm0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":156531,"name":"Floating life in Other-world","summary":"Floating life in Other-world is a life simulation independent game based on magic .

There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. Though he was young, he made himself a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.","genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Culture Brain"],"publishers":["Culture Brain"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Wii U","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6nvx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":304316,"name":"Flat Machine","summary":"In the not-so-distant future, a fate-bound settlement installs a gatekeeper robot with no limbs or memories.\n\nTo guard the settlement in this post-apocalyptic world, the gatekeeper robot must respond to various visitors, from mutants and thieves to even rogue microwaves.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1702166400,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9qmz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":281687,"name":"Flying Disk","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1104451200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":88782,"name":"Flick Home Run!","summary":"You only use flick to control the batting for this game.

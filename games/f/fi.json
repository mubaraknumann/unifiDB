Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country's respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries' servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a \"Focus\", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead, so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them.

It combines several characters from various Sega games, from the complete cast of Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers to Janet from Virtua Cop 2 and the Hornet car from Daytona USA, while allowing to play the bosses of both games without codes.\nHighly advertised, it followed Virtua Fighter 2 as a high-profile 3D fighting game for the Sega Saturn. Intended as an introduction to Virtua Fighter 3 (which was never released for the Saturn), Fighters Megamix utilized the concept originally used by The King of Fighters, whereby characters and styles from different games were mixed together. Not only the open ended rings from VF are present (but now, with no ring-out), but also the closed cages from Fighting Vipers. VF characters have new moves taken from VF3, but the most impressive feature was the dodge move, which allowed characters to sidestep, avoiding a dangerous blow and opening at the same time room for a counter. Sega capitalized on this, calling Fighters Megamix the first \"real 3D\" fighting game in the market.\nUnlike most of AM2's games of the era, Fighters Megamix did not have an arcade release. In 1998 a Game.com port was released by Tiger Electronics.","genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"developers":["Sega AM2"],"publishers":["Sega"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":851126400,"platforms":["Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4jb6.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"19043","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-19043/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"17439","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fighters Megamix"}]},{"igdb_id":1655,"name":"Final Fight","summary":"Final Fight is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up produced by Capcom. Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom","Kixx","U.S. Gold"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":627955200,"platforms":["Arcade","Sharp X68000","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","iOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4a0q.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6147","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Final Fight"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6722","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-6722/"}]},{"igdb_id":1656,"name":"Final Fight 2","summary":"A beat'em up sequel to Final Fight, released originally for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom","Playtronic"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":738028800,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Wii","Wii U","New Nintendo 3DS","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7pmw.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"14608","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-14608/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"13403","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Final Fight 2"}]},{"igdb_id":1657,"name":"Final Fight 3","summary":"YOU CAN TEACH A NEW SKULL OLD TRICKS\n\nMetro City is under attack, and this time a new crime organization is claiming responsibility.

Tightwad, whom the circus owes $10,000, arrives on the scene with the intent of demolishing the circus unless it can pay up. He plans to build a set of luxury hotels on the terrain. In a fit of desperation, the ringmaster organises a display of six events to raise money for the doomed circus: diving, juggling, trapeze, knife throwing, tightrope and the human cannonball. The performance in each event is judged by five clown judges, who offer money depending on the quality of the show. The businessman has no intention of letting the circus raise the cash though, and he sends his lackey, the evil Fiendish Freddy, to sabotage the acts.\nEach player is represented by a circus animal (tiger, lion, bear, etc.)\n\nThe game was similar to many of the multi-event sports games of the time such as Epyx' California Games, Winter Games and Summer Games. However, Fiendish Freddy differed not only by its surroundings (circus events) offering a comedy element, it also offered a plot and a clear goal of winning $10,000. The six events were thus:\n\nThe player is challenged to jump off four diving boards of increasing height into containers of water of decreasing size, beginning with a huge wooden container, and ending in a glass of water. (The third target, however, is a cement block, a possible homage to the Looney Tunes cartoon Big Top Bunny, amongst other things.) Money is earned by completing all four levels, as well as performing a set series of stunts. Freddy attempts to hinder the player by blowing the diver off course with an enormous hair dryer; he appears if the diver fails to complete the stunt in time.\n\nThe player must make their way through four juggling sessions of increasing difficulty. Each level brings more balls to juggle, but not just balls - sometimes babies get lost in the mass and must be thrown back into their prams. Of course, Freddy throws a surprise or two into the mix, in the form of bombs, which can be thrown back at Freddy to consequently explode in his face, or missiles which must be juggled as per other objects. Dropping bombs or missiles will cause them to explode and kill the juggler.\nThe juggler is allowed five mistakes (marked by dots changing from green to red) before the game is over. Missing five times without dying from a bomb or missile leads an off-stage performer to use a cane to grab the juggler and yank him off screen.\n\nThe aim of this section is to proceed from right to left over three levels, jumping from rope to rope. Along the way there are rings of fire and moving targets which have to be mastered. Freddy, as usual, is omnipresent with a jet pack and large pair of scissors to cut your act short if you are too slow.\nSights on the ground, ranging from a marching band and organ to a trainer with his elephant, are also present as a possible distraction, although it can also be argued that the former are providing the music for the act.\n\nThe player must throw knives at balloons on a rotating wheel with a female assistant strapped to it. The assistant is not a target, and will scream if hit, as well as the screen getting covered in blood. There are a limited number of knives available. If the player does not manage to burst all of the balloons before the time or knives run out, it's over. Freddy contributes to the challenge once in a while by throwing smoke grenades in to hinder the player's vision.\n\nThe player must walk across three tightropes armed only with a pole to keep balance. Freddy intervenes occasionally with his jet pack, attempting to knock the player off the rope, or with razor blades to cut the player in half. The blades can be deflected with the pole.\n\nThe final event involves an attempt by the player to launch him or herself into a target from a cannon. The amount of gunpowder in the cannon is predetermined, and the player has to judge the angle necessary to launch the character into the target. Freddy plays a smaller role in this subgame - he only gets involved if the player takes too long to decide upon the angle, upon which he destroys the cannon.\n\nThere are two endings to the game.\nIf the player collected enough money to save the circus, the performers get their revenge on Freddy by launching a portly diva with a seesaw, crushing Freddy.\nIf the player failed to get enough money, the circus is demolished and a building labeled as Freddy Towers is erected in its place.","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["Gray Matter"],"publishers":["Mindscape, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","PC (Microsoft Windows)","DOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2s4k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1680154175","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/fiendish_freddys_big_top_o_fun"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2256430","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2256430"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"850","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fiendish%20Freddy's%20Big%20Top%20O'%20Fun"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"925","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-925/"}]},{"igdb_id":12096,"name":"Fightin' Spirit","summary":"Fightin' Spirit is a one-on-one beat 'em up centred around a competition by a gang overlord to find new heavies for his organisation.

During development, the team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from FFXI while creating something that stood on its own. Due to several factors, the development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on the game. Attempts to bring the game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with Microsoft about the use of Xbox Live.\n\nAfter its alpha test and a delayed beta test, the game went live on September 30, 2010, remaining active until its servers were closed on November 11, 2012. At launch, the game received a mixed to negative reaction: while the graphics and music met with general praise, other aspects were unanimously panned, including the gameplay, interface, and the general impression of the game being unfinished at launch.\n\nCritic and fan backlash caused Square Enix to pull subscription fees, indefinitely postpone the PlayStation 3 version, and eventually develop an entirely new version of the game called FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE: A REALM REBORN.

You select your other modes with the joystick. Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land.\n\nNavigation\nIn navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode.\n\nTorpedo\nIf you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.\n\nSea-to-land\nIf you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see \"Dock for refueling\" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city.\n\nSea-to-air\nIf a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite. Use you joystick, or the trak-ball , if you plugged one into port 2, to aim at an incoming missile and press fire to blast it. If it gets past you but has not reached your city, you get a \"Refocusing\" message and the view switches to a short range view where you will get one more try.\n\nBe warned that ships can attack you no matter what mode you are in.

We've added more words, more languages, and support for phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers. The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically. A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen. After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA. Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first. Scoring Successful landing=25 points Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress.

Many fighters are original designs, and each fighter has plenty of unique and special attacks you can perform. The animations are excellent, and the controls intuitive. The computer players are very challenging - a lot of them will run up to you at lightning speed and perform 10+ hits combo before you can react. This may frustrate fighting game novices, although experts should welcome the chance to play a tough fanmade fighting game for once. The game is in Japanese, but it shouldn't be hard to figure out the controls If you enjoy beat'em ups, Fighters Kyodotai is a very well-made freeware old game that is well worth your time and the hefty download. Be warned of two minor weaknesses, though: the game doesn't let you change difficulty level or save key configurations.

Playable from start to finish as of 2020, the hack boasts 43 total chapters, 62 playable characters, and various unique mechanics that help to set it apart from the game it deviates from.\n\nOn the continent of Yaska lies six distinct nations, including the empire of Nevan, led by Emperor Festan. The imperial state of Belaro, led by Lord Gradin, has resorted to heavily taxing its citizens, jailing those who cannot comply. Needless to say, this proves unpopular with the state's population, including Storch, a young farmer, and his friends and family. Soon, he's resorting to stealing from the rich to be able to help his family avoid prison. One excursion into a relatively wealthy part of Belaro ultimately leads him down a path that would change the course of Nevan's history.\n\nDesigned to be played as an ironman run, hence the large cast, Vision Quest boasts an incredible amount of content and a tone that slides carefully between drama and humor with its character interactions and small scale compared to most Fire Emblem games (more in line with Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 than anything else). The game is divided into four parts, similar to Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, with each progressively growing in scale without ever resorting to having you fight dragons or gods. The patch can be found at the link provided.

Taxan published the localized NES version on April 1989, making it one of the earliest Fist of the North Star products released in the U.S. alongside Viz Communications' English adaptation of the manga.\n\nThe main differences from the Japanese version are:\n\n- The Japanese version is harder because projectiles are randomly thrown at you from the sides of the screen like in the previous game and the first two mini-bosses have to be hit in their heads.\n- Kenshiro's color was changed from black to blue.\n- The \"abeshi\" and \"hidebu\" power-ups were changed to white and black stars.\n- The NPCs that appear at the end of some stages were removed for the US version.\n- In the Japanese version, when you use a continue you are dropped in Stage 4.

The Lucians have been able to keep Niflheim at bay, mainly because the capital Insomnia is protected by the Wall, a magical shield powered by a crystal. At the start of the game an armistice is proposed as well as a union of states through the marriage of Prince Noctis of Lucis and Lady Lunafreya of Tenebrae, a separate nation with limited political power due to the influence of a priestess called the Oracle. The game opens when Noctis, the only playable character, travels with his friends Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto to Accordo where the wedding is to take place. Along the way it is revealed Niflheim has betrayed Lucis and the crystal has been stolen with many important figures killed. Noctis' main quest becomes to reclaim the throne and rescue the crystal.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1480377600,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6k6s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":205673,"name":"Final Fantasy IX","summary":"The console version of Final Fantasy IX brings enhanced character models, updated UI and fully remastered cutscenes.

Various spells, abilities and items were removed or altered, shop prices were lowered, and other tweaks to make the game easy were put in place. Many enemies, attacks and items were renamed.\n\nIt is often thought the original North American translation was a translation of Easy Type, but the translated version was developed before Easy Type, and the difficulty is reduced further in Easy Type than in the North American version. This led to speculation that Easy Type was based on the North American Final Fantasy II rather than vice versa.\n\nAnother aspect Easy Type changed is some of the text, which was simplified to make it easier for younger Japanese players to read and to help bring the point of certain comments across more clearly. For example, when Palom clears the fire on Mt. Ordeals with his Blizzard spell and brags about it, Porom reminds him that the Elder of Mysidia taught them they should not be haughty. The word for \"haughty\" was replaced with the word for \"arrogant\", as \"haughty\" is not a common word in an average child's vocabulary.","genres":["Role-playing

When it was re-released for the Playstation, the graphics were uncensored but toned down script remained. Then came Final Fantasy VI Advance with a newer (though some consider drier) translation, but the color palette and music were altered for the handheld console. Others have made re-translations, such as the great work by RPGOne, Lina Darkstar, and Kwhazit.\n\nNow this is Final Fantasy VI: Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition. The goal was to make the SNES version uncut and to clean up the script but keep the nuance used by Woolsey in the original game’s release. Using the original Woolsey script as a basis to analyze, the entire game was looked through, line by line, using FFVI Advance, RPGOne, and Lina Darkstar to accomplish this. Recently, the game’s script was also heavily analyzed by Kwhazit and Mato (Legends of Localization). With these newer and more heavily detailed looks into the game, the script was again updated to provide a much more accurate version while still remaining true to the original game’s release.\n\nAlso used was various tools and patches to uncensor the graphics, restore Character Class names, extend spell names, rename monsters and items, and make hopefully the version of Final Fantasy VI that everyone will play.\n\nAny bug fixes or additions that were used were chosen not for any balance changes, but to fix persistent issues in the game, as to not change the experience of the original too much. This even includes the long list used in the optional Bug-Fix versions of the game.\n\nAdditional Add-Ons are also optionally included. These tweaks bring an overall complete experience that many would say should have been in the original game to begin with.\n\nThe Music Player included with the game has been altered for compatibility with Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Rodimus Primal"],"publishers":["Rodimus Primal"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1645228800,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coae2b.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":246588,"name":"Final Fantasy VI: Return of the Dark Sorcerer","summary":"Return of the Dark Sorcerer is an incredibly large fan-made Final Fantasy 6 modification that’s been in development since around 2010. Originally the brainchild of Gi Nattak, the project has evolved over the years thanks to a dedicated team and other skilled members of the FF6 romhacking community.\n\nThis mod promises to showcase some of the challenging aspects of FF6 romhacking, as well as plenty of fun and exciting new content; from an all new cast of playable characters with customized movesets, a radically changed story with many new and edited events, new overworld maps, a new musical soundtrack, difficulty selection, new battle scripts for monsters & bosses, and an absolute ton of custom monster/esper and NPC sprites.\n\nIt is a highly personalized modification of the original game and therefore naturally won’t appeal to everyone. It’s not a sequel, or a prequel, or a remake to FF6, it is quite simply a massive amalgamation mod and customization of FF6 which does contain a whole bunch of references and can be rather nonsensical or even immersion-breaking at times… but if you go into it prepared for this, you should have a much more enjoyable experience. That being said, a whole lot of time and energy has gone into this project and we are quite pleased with the result.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Mike Ferrell"],"publishers":["Mike Ferrell"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1419984000,"platforms":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9v5a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":246717,"name":"Fiona's Farm","summary":"Welcome to Fiona’s Farm!

Tomorrow, the legions would resume the attack; rested, reinforced, against starving, demoralised and desperate conscripts. Tomorrow, the Guard would break…\n\nFE: Drums of War is a full campaign total conversion hack, that implements a wide array of custom graphics, QoL patches and unique objectives, while still operating within the non-SkillSys GBAFE framework. It features 22 chapters, a cast of 46 playable characters and over 50 complete support chains, as well as a number of non-essential secrets. It aims to tell a nuanced, grounded story, without reverting to tired cynicism; no matter how dark the hour, it is strength to be found in each other, and a new day will always come.\n\nIn gameplay, emphasis is placed on decisive, aggressive play to deal with tight, hard-hitting enemy formations that will overwhelm passive play and outflank lowmanning. It is probably closest in difficulty to Radiant Dawn’s Normal mode, or the Hard/Classic setting of more recent titles, and is designed to be ironman-friendly with clear signposting, a tough lord, and a constant stream of available recruits. An easier campaign with Casual Mode implementation is planned for a future release.","genres":["Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1682121600,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co87gs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":274407,"name":"Final Fantasy Sonic X: Episode 2","summary":"The second installment to the FFSX series.","genres":["Point-and-click","Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["BlackDevilX"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1099267200,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co96hk.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"351661745","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Final%20Fantasy%20Sonic%20X:%20Episode%202"}]},{"igdb_id":274408,"name":"Final Fantasy Sonic X: Episode 3","summary":"The third installment to the FFSX series.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["BlackDevilX"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1106784000,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co96hm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2070581193","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Final%20Fantasy%20Sonic%20X:%20Episode%203"}]},{"igdb_id":274409,"name":"Final Fantasy Sonic X: Episode 4","summary":"The fourth installment to the FFSX series.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":["BlackDevilX"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1122854400,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7ka0.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1473397507","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Final%20Fantasy%20Sonic%20X:%20Episode%204"}]},{"igdb_id":274410,"name":"Final Fantasy Sonic X: Episode 5","summary":"The fifth installment to the FFSX series.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["BlackDevilX"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1136851200,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co96hh.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"779442720","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Final%20Fantasy%20Sonic%20X:%20Episode%205"}]},{"igdb_id":274411,"name":"Final Fantasy Sonic X: Episode 6","summary":"The sixth installment to the FFSX series.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["BlackDevilX"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1212796800,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7axh.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1966444656","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Final%20Fantasy%20Sonic%20X:%20Episode%206"}]},{"igdb_id":274558,"name":"Fighting for Singleship: I am Chased by a Bunch of Women But I Just Want to Play Video Games","summary":"You relish indoor life, gaming, but now, a challenging twist: every woman adores you.

The machines are similar to Rube Goldberg devices and involve releasing a bolt from a wrench and then have it reach a box. For each machine the player has access to a toolbox with a certain amount of components of various kinds that have to be placed on the playing field to complete the machine. Most common are the elbows (l-shaped pipes) which change the direction of the bolt and the converters which change the property of the bolt. The bolt can be small and hollow, large and hollow, small and solid or large and solid and these properties have to match with the properties of the box and the parts. For example, to reflect a small and hollow bolt only an elbow with those properties will work. There is also the bouncer which rebounds the bolt in the opposite direction and the key which the bolt has to pass through to enter a locked box.\n\nThe game consists of 200 machines. The first 100 only uses regular parts while the latter 100 contains modified parts. These differ in that their properties change every time they are touched by the bolt. The parts can also rotated and change position. Machines can be built in any order even if previous ones have not been completed. Additionally there is an editor that allows the player to create new machines.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Random House"],"publishers":["Random House"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["Apple IIGS","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7eu8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"759700086","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fix%20It"}]},{"igdb_id":278238,"name":"First Time In Hawaii: Collector's Edition","summary":"Kate and Nicole Robinson hit up Hawaii for a very special occassion: the wedding of their good friend Stella!

Leo has been repurposed from a guest to a main character, with a full character arc, sidequests, and even his own musical theme. In addition, every named character receives an end to their story arc, both main characters and side characters.\n\nThere are more edits than just storyline modifications though. Instead of replacing an existing character, Leo is added as a 15th fully-playable character. A secret 16th character has been added too. You can even recruit crew members to the Falcon! There are new spells, new espers, new abilities, a reduced encounter rate, dummied content restored, and more. Over 2 dozen hackers are listed in the credits of the manual for contributions to this project.\n\nEven with all of those changes listed, Divergent Paths has become somewhat noteworthy not for its changes, but for its restraint. There is no difficulty rebalancing, no retranslation, no graphical changes, and only a handful of spells and items renamed. Every change is made in service to its characters, and the core of the game remains the same.

The game is based on the 16th century Chinese epic novel of the same name, also called Fēngshén Yǎnyì (封神演義) and often translated to Investiture of the Gods or The Creation of the Gods.\nThe game is essentially a hacked version of Hummer Team's earlier bootleg version of DragonBall Z: Super Butōden 2, which was originally released on the Super NES. The change by Waixing was made to legitimize the content as to not run into copyright laws, as this version was also released (although still unlicensed by Nintendo) in Japan and with likely intent to distribute outside of Asia.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Hummer Technology","Waixing"],"publishers":["Waixing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ulk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":343186,"name":"Fēng zhī Gǔ II","summary":null,"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Sintax"],"publishers":["Sintax"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Game Boy Color"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":350519,"name":"Fēngsè Huànxiǎng III: ～Zuì Yǔ Fá De Zhèn Hún Gē～","summary":"Wind Fantasy 3: The Soul Song Of Sin & Punishment is a strategic role-playing game developed by Hongyu Technology, released on November 17, 2004.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["FUN YOURS Technology"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1100563200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa0qn.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"154184814","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/F%C4%93ngs%C3%A8%20Hu%C3%A0nxi%C7%8Eng%20III:%20%EF%BD%9EZu%C3%AC%20Y%C7%94%20F%C3%A1%20De%20Zh%C3%A8n%20H%C3%BAn%20G%C4%93%EF%BD%9E"}]},{"igdb_id":369187,"name":"Fēngkuáng Pào Pào Bǔyú","summary":"The ultimate fishing game makes its grand debut!\nExperience classic fishing gameplay with screen-filling bosses and massive 100,000x multipliers, where coins burst nonstop for endless excitement.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Fēngkuáng Pào Pào Bǔyú"],"publishers":["Fēngkuáng Pào Pào Bǔyú"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1634860800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coalaj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":375428,"name":"Fēng Shén Ràng Wǒ Lái","summary":"“Who decides the will of heaven?

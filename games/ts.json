Yuuto and the townspeople welcomed the girl, Ai, to their town.\n\nCome spring, the entrance ceremony was underway. The new students took pictures and videos in front of the school with their parents to commemorate this special day.

She searched for a reason for living, whereas he ran away from reality through his imaginative drawings. Even though they were polar opposites, their backgrounds also made them quite similar.

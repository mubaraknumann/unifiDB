The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.\n\nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.\n\nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models.

It was re-released for the Virtual Console service worldwide for the Wii in 2007 and in Japan for the Wii U on April 16, 2014; it was re-released for the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2010 and in North America in 2011. The game takes place in the land of Neutopia, where the evil demon Dirth has captured Princess Aurora and has stolen the eight ancient medallions which contain the wisdom and power necessary to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the land. It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people.\n\nNeutopia is widely regarded as a clone of the popular Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda in nearly every aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over Zelda, but various shortcomings – which include long passwords, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection – prevent the game from being superior over the 1987 Nintendo title.

One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls.\n\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you. There's just one solution: set sail for Westgate and discover the secret of the Night Masks in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate.\n\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Complete is an epic RPG set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular campaign settings of Dungeons & Dragons. Use all the wicked spells, feats, and prestige classes from the D&D 3.5 rules. Create your characters any way you wish, choosing from a wide variety of races and subraces, such as Tiefling and Aasimar.

Developed by the Slovakian team Darksoft Game Development Studio and the Czech company Cinemax, Necromania challenges players to navigate labyrinthine environments and overcome various enemies and creatures to acquire fragments of a powerful magic key.\n\nThe story centers around the fallen dark lord, Ragnar, who finds himself imprisoned by the forces of the Absurdian king, Bill Cocoton. In a bid to set Ragnar free and seize control of the realm, seven of Ragnar's loyal minions awaken from their slumber, each vying to obtain the magic keys that can unlock their master's prison. However, only one of them can ultimately lead the army of darkness to victory. As players progress through the game's numerous levels, they must strategize, laying traps and leveraging the intricacies of the environments to outsmart their adversaries.\n\nWhile Necromania: Trap of Darkness received mixed reviews, critics praised its multiplayer mode, even though finding opponents proved challenging. However, the game faced criticism for its unrefined gameplay mechanics and notable difficulty. The title offered an interesting blend of puzzle-like elements and combat, with an emphasis on trap utilization rather than direct confrontation. The lack of balance among the character classes and dated visuals added to the overall underwhelming experience. Despite its attempts to innovate, Necromania: Trap of Darkness fell short of leaving a lasting impression in the gaming landscape.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Darksoft Game Development Studio","CINEMAX, s.r.o."],"publishers":["Strategy First"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1030492800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6qa7.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"13084","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-13084/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"12008","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Necromania%3A%20Trap%20of%20Darkness"}]},{"igdb_id":69605,"name":"Nemesis Crisis: Operation Gallant Thunder","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"11145","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Nemesis%20Crisis%3A%20Operation%20Gallant%20Thunder"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"12132","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-12132/"}]},{"igdb_id":69696,"name":"Neverend","summary":"NeverEnd presents a swords-and-sorcery adventure that tells a whimsical fairy tale.

After creating the character, gameplay takes place on a screen that displays text interactions, the names and current status of one's party of characters, and a window which displays images of geography marked with various pictures of characters or events. When combat occurs, gameplay switches to full-screen combat mode, in which a player's characters and enemies are represented by icons which move around in the course of battle.\n\nSituated in the city of Neverwinter and more than twenty surrounding regions/areas, the game itself was similar to other official AD&D Forgotten Realms games of its time.

Rebuilt with artificial limbs, a reinforced spine, and a data-linked brain, you are no longer entirely human. They call you the Anomaly—a being that shouldn’t exist. Protogens reconstructed your dying body with forbidden technology after recovering you from an unregistered crash site on the surface. They won’t say why they did it.

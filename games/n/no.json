It was a spin-off from the Legacy of Kain series of action-adventure games, and took place in its eponymous fictional universe. Nosgoth employed a player versus player system in which each match consisted of two rounds. Teams were composed of characters assigned to one of two races: vampires, designed around hack and slash combat; and humans, whose gameplay was styled after third-person shooters. Between rounds, teams would switch to control the opposing race, and the team which accumulated the most points by fighting their counterparts won the match.\n\nInitially announced in June 2013 following internet leaks, Nosgoth was the first Legacy of Kain-associated game to debut in almost ten years, preceded by 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Though once intended for release as part of a single-player project, Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun, it was reconceptualized and continued development as a standalone title following Dead Sun's cancellation. When officially revealed in September 2013, Nosgoth attracted negative reception for its conceptual departure from the traditional single-player and story-driven Legacy of Kain formula. Initially beginning its closed alpha and opening up its servers to registered players in late 2013, the game's open beta began in January 2015 and ended in May 2016.\n\nOn April 8, 2016, Square Enix Europe announced that Nosgoth's servers would shut down on May 31, 2016.

The tank can move in 8 directions. The fire button causes the tank to shoot in the direction it is moving. On each screen, there are active and dormant enemy tanks. As the screens progress, the tanks are worth more and more, but the dormant tanks are always worth twice as much as the active ones. Of course they are well guarded! The scenery consists of a few trees and a river which you can only cross by bridge. If you shoot an active tank, one of the dormant tanks will spring to life and come after you. The object of the game is to clear the level and go on to the next one before they kill you. Each succeeding level has more enemies, and moves faster and faster. The game plays a tune at the start of each level, and then there is a JAWS-like tune that it plays as you play. As the battle gets more and more frantic, so does the music. The tank makes a simple but interesting sound that is unique to this game. It is a sort of rumbling sound that you'd expect, but it has a squeaky sound like metal or ball-bearings grinding.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1505433600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27xs.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"666560","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/666560"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"437999210","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/No%20mans%20land"}]},{"igdb_id":37330,"name":"Noboranka","summary":"This game is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up where the player controls a character that has to climb a tree and shoot bug-like enemies.

Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students learn how notes are spaced out across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"??

Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards!

Even in cutscenes, which are zoomed in and show much more detail than the regular game graphics, the 8-bit style is preserved. Only during combat, which is not at all like Ys but held in typical JRPG fashion, the characters are replaced by much more realisticly pixeled sprites. Oddly, only one half of the unusually wide battlefield is displayed at any given time, with the camera scrolling abck and forth during attacks. \n \nThe game design feels equally archaic. The different regions of the game world are accessed in fairly linear order, but it got the same kind of undocumented hidden passages, unspecific aims and inconspicious event triggers as the classics. Other than most 8-bit games, though, enemy encounters can be seen on the map beforehand and therefore be avoided, but once they see the player party, they hunt them down relentlessly.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xj8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"2050729362","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Nostalgia%20of%20Magic"}]},{"igdb_id":145643,"name":"Northern Blade","summary":"Northern Blade is a dynamic action MMORPG from one of the oldest domestic developers.

The numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of \"4 8 3\" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups.\nTo solve a puzzle, one needs to determine which cells will be boxes and which will be empty. Determining which cells are to be left empty (called spaces) is as important as determining which to fill (called boxes). Later in the solving process, the spaces help determine where a clue (continuing block of boxes and a number in the legend) may spread. Solvers usually use a dot or a cross to mark cells they are certain are spaces.\nIt is also important never to guess. Only cells that can be determined by logic should be filled.

Despite all the scale and apparent complexity, the content of the mod is quickly mastered and remembered.\n\nEverything new is a well-forgotten old. It is this phrase that most aptly characterizes the modification. Changes do not cause rejection, and innovations significantly expand the usual aspects of the game. Even completing original campaigns with the mod won't be a chore. You'll get a whole new experience, and you'll love it.\n\nIn addition to the legendary Battle for Vizgard, the author creates new maps that are strikingly different from everything that you could pass before. It is on them that you can test your strategic abilities. AI, which in the original almost did not pose a threat, will be able to give you a decent rebuff. Now PvE is not about clearing the map of neutrals in an attempt to collect trophies and upgrade troops, it's a real fierce battle with a computer opponent.\n\nThe Norwegian Salmon mod is also notable for providing advanced mapping tools.

As your character talks with Yumi or any other character, topic icons stream across this bar, so click on them and they will be transferred to the data window.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":["Flight-Plan"],"publishers":["Pioneer LDC","HAMSTER"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":902361600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coause.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1711030236","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/NO%C3%ABL:%20La%20Niege%20Special"}]},{"igdb_id":378021,"name":"Nocturnal Watch","summary":"In this short anomaly horror game your job is to patrol the forest at the northern border.

[{"igdb_id":6120,"name":"N-Sub","summary":"N-Sub is one of the earliest naval video game titles.\n\nThe object of the game is to maneuver an on-screen submarine, the \"N-Sub,\" with the joystick and sink the enemy fleet with torpedo fire in the Cobalt Blue Sea. Torpedoes can be fired vertically or horizontally by means of two separate 'FIRE' buttons and 3 torpedoes can be fired in rapid succession by keeping the button depressed. The enemy ships attack the N-Sub with missiles, torpedoes and depth charges. One round is over after the attack by the enemy fleet of twelve ships (No. 1 Fleet Black, No. 2 Fleet Blue) and the loop attack by the enemy destroyer. Enemy attack gains in ferocity with each new round. Bonus points are awarded if the fleet of twelve ships and the destroyer are destroyed. One extra N-Sub is added if players attain high score. The game is over when all of a player's N-Subs are sunk.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Compile","Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"publishers":["Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":347068800,"platforms":["Arcade","SG-1000"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7e8f.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":25606,"name":"NSFW: Not a Simulator for Working","summary":"NSFW or Not a Simulator For Working is casual simulator game where you try not to work anytime you can.

Join JC, Justin, Chris, Joey, and Lance in the most daring adventure the group has ever embarked upon, helping them get to the show before curtain time. Of course, life is never easy for these highly sought-after recording artists, so you'll have to help them with such challenges as making snacks and running errands in a stretch limousine. If you can accomplish these feats, you might even get to help the band warm up for their big show with a friendly game of hackey-sack! Packed with challenges and dangerous distractions, the game's real appeal is its goofball spirit and dedication to the band itself. Each of the group's members' distinct personality shines through, making this an awesome title for anyone who likes NSYNC.

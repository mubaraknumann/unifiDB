It is similar to the PC and console versions of the same name and by the same developer. Those versions are not identical and described as an \"upmake\" of the NES version. The game borrows elements from Windjammers, which served as an inspiration.\n\nPlayers select one of six characters from a cast with names such as Rad Carlton, Bruiser Bogardus, Hot Foot Francis, Sparerib Boneapart, Mayo Monsoon or Ollie Oilsack. There are also multiple environments and different game modes. The characters are described as lumberjacks. Matches take place on a fixed screen view shown from an elevated position. Characters are standing on rolling logs and throw an axe that acts like a ball.\n\nIn a typical tournament different opponents need to be defeated one after the other. Points are scored by throwing the axe into the goal area behind the opponent. This zone is different for each environment. Sometimes there is only a single, large goal area, while another environment has three zones for five, two and five points respectively. In some levels like North Pool the middle part is entirely open, while in others like Mount Olympus the axe can only be thrown through a few open passages.\n\nThe opponent guards these areas and attempts to catch or bounce back the axe to try the same on the other side. A set is won when someone reaches twelve points. The best of three sets wins a match. Special items appear during matches such as stars (use a signature throw different for each character), magnets (increase catching range for five seconds), ice cubes (decrease the opponent's movement speed for a short amount of time) and oil (the axe cannot be caught for five seconds and will bounce back instead, and at a reduced speed). There are counters for some power-ups. For instance, when the signature throw is caught by the opponent, their signature throw becomes active right away.\n\nThe game supports competitive multiplayer against another opponent on the same screen. The game comes in a box with a green cartridge and a full colour manual.","genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"developers":["Mega Cat Studios"],"publishers":["Mega Cat Studios","Plug In Digital"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1514678400,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3j6y.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":336987,"name":"Love & Knights Solitaire","summary":null,"genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":["DigiMight"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cob90q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":72769,"name":"Loving Deads: The House of the Dead EX","summary":"House of the Dead EX is a spin-off of the series and takes more of a comedy approach to the Sega franchise.

While magic energy existed in all living creatures beforehand, it suddenly became far more powerful thirty years before the beginning of the game. Because of this, it has affected society greatly, with devices called \"Magic Engines\" harnessing this power for lighting, automobiles, communication, and robots, among other uses. While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction. The kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, remains isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat. Uhra, at war with Khent, a nation of beastmen, sends its forces to the Highlands of Wohl for a decisive battle at the start of the game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["Feelplus","Mistwalker"],"publishers":["Microsoft Game Studios"],"aggregated_rating":67.5,"release_date":1196899200,"platforms":["Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3tos.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":378044,"name":"Lord of Darkness: Celebration","summary":"This is the final game in the \"Lord of Darkness\" trilogy in the genre of old JRPGs with a turn-based combat system.

A Japanese man and woman portrayed in the distinct business man/woman (\"Kaisha-in 事務員\") satire comedy Kotobuki Shiriagari \"Heta-Uma へたうま\" style, turn up at work but they can't understand the greetings their co-workers are saying. Suddenly a silver-haired devil turns up mumbling something. The man and woman say: \"He just said しつれいします, didn't he?\", prompting the start screen to launch. Logos Panic pits players to scramble Japanese Kanji in a sort of Tetris puzzle style scenario; kanji must be correctly put together in time, simultaneously as new kanji pop out at the bottom of the screen. The game ends when the player can't assemble appropriate sentences in time. At the beginning there are only eight selectable characters but as the game progresses, another three will eventually appear. It uses a password system to allow players to pick up and play at their leisure.\n\nLogos Panic is about garbled versions of greeting words. Goaisatu \"ごあいさつ\" or greetings are the words used in the game being 'garbled' and pretty random, not just greetings. They are puzzled over the greetings \"aisatsu します\". The two players have to create words that appear in red, yellow and blue at the sides of the screen, aspects to consider are players and the blue line to pay attention to, in order to correctly put the katakanas in their correct grammatical place.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Kan's"],"publishers":["St. GIGA","Yutaka"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":814838400,"platforms":["Satellaview","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co47nm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":29592,"name":"LOR - League of Runners","summary":"You will fight for the title of best runner in a beautiful fantasy world.

As the game title suggests, this game involves looping. By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games. By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect). Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop. One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down. While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough.

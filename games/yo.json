Players navigate around the open world using the Nintendo 3DS' touchscreen to find and befriend various Yo-kai, which are scattered across the overworld. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. A new feature in battles is using the touch screen to find a particular sweetspot on an enemy Yo-kai to increase the likelihood of befriending it at the end of the battle, or other sweetspots for extra damage, extra money, or extra experience. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Crank-a-kai (Gasha Machine) by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game's main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended. When the player encounters a Yo-kai, he enters into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player's Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai's Soultimate abilities. While the original Yo-kai Watch featured nearly 250 Yo-kai, Yo-Kai Watch 2 features nearly 450, including several that were featured as bosses in the original game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["LEVEL-5"],"publishers":["LEVEL-5","Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":66.875,"release_date":1404950400,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co24jl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":138653,"name":"You Arrive In A Town","summary":"Assemble a party and journey through a tabletop game inspired world in our 1-4 player RPG Lite game You Arrive In A Town!

Yoshi will not stand for this outlandish attempt at flattening his world, and he heads off on an adventure to return things back to their original state. To help in on his quest, a group of spirits who like to surprise people give Yoshi the ability to rotate the world to his liking. The big catch with Yoshi Topsy-Turvy is its use of a motion sensor, similar to the one set to be featured in the second Wario Ware GBA game. The game cartridge includes a built in motion sensor which detects how you move the GBA system. By turning the system, you make the world rotate. A meter on the upper right corner of the screen shows which way the system is being held at any time. Rotate the system to help Yoshi stay on the path and make it past perils and through the varied stages.\nGo full tilt! By tilting your Game Boy Advance, you'll tilt the environment around Yoshi, knocking over enemies, swinging pendulums, and letting Yoshi run up walls and leap huge pits! Will this ending be happy? All of Yoshi's Island is trapped in a storybook, and only by meeting the challenges of each chapter will you succeed.

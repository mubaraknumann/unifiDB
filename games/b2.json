[{"igdb_id":44127,"name":"B-24","summary":"A simulation of WW2 air-warfare in which the player flies a B-24 as part of the 460th Bomber Group missions to Ploesti in Romania. The game operates on several levels, and the player will be required to act as a pilot, copilot, navigator, engineer and bombardier at different stages of each mission. The performance of your B-24 influences the effectiveness of your Group, Wing and ultimately the Air Force itself. B-24 is a simulator with a difference - you control your bomber (and the Group) from a top-down perspective rather than from a 1st person perspective.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)"],"publishers":["SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","DOS","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8i7i.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":114529,"name":"B-25 Game","summary":"Play as a gunner in B-25 bomber.

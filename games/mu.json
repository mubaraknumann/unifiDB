Character progress up a ladder of 11 levels until they reach the traditional Multi-User Dungeon goal of wiz (wizard or witch).\n\nCharacters move between locations, or game rooms, using compass directions, and basic commands such as \"get longsword\", \"get diamond\", \"kill dwarf with longsword\". Points are scored by dropping treasure in the room known as the swamp, killing an NPC, or killing another player. The game also includes magical powers, which are gained through a mystical artifact known as The Touchstone. The small side effect of this is that touching the Touchstone may kill you, with the likelihood of death decreasing as you get higher in level. In order to make Wiz, one must also complete seven of eight tasks. Among wizzes' many powers is the ability to instantly kill any player in the land, using the much-vaunted Finger of Death, or FOD.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":481075200,"platforms":["Linux","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4vdp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":322887,"name":"Mushroom Kingdom Emissary","summary":null,"genres":["Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":34678,"name":"Murasaki","summary":"\"Murasaki\" is a puzzle explosion game.\nUse explosions to clear the screen of pesky obstacles filling it up.\nThe only controls you need are the directional buttons and two other buttons (Z and X)!","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Katatema"],"publishers":["PLAYISM"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1463011200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3pfo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":154931,"name":"Mutant Football League: Brawltimore Razors","summary":"Brawltimore Razors DLC includes Brawltimore Razors team and arena.This content requires the base game Mutant Football League in order to play.","genres":["Fighting","Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Sport","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3dr1.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":372219,"name":"Multiverse Designer","summary":"Multiverse Designer is a 3D virtual tabletop and map creator, a unique toolbox for storytellers.

They formed an alliance and struck at Swedish territories hoping for a swift and decisive victory. However, they had seriously miscalculated the strength of the Swedish military and the resolve of their new monarch and by 1701 all had been defeated. Their attack launched a grueling 21 year war which would drag other countries into the conflict.\n\nThe Great Northern War highlighted the military genius of Charles XII and the resilience of the Swedish military who held off defeat for 21 years. It also saw the rise of Tsar Peter I who reformed the Russian military and adapted tactics and strategy to play to Russian strengths which would ultimately defeat an exhausted Sweden.\n\nThe Great Northern War includes 69 Scenarios – covering all sizes and situations, including a solo tutorial scenario plus specialized versions for both head to head play and vs. the computer AI.

The action takes place nearly 100 years prior to The Hobbit but long after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key to Erebor has just been found by Gandalf in Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take place.\n\nMUME covers 28,000+ original rooms from the mighty Dwarven Halls beyond the Gulf of the Lhûn in the West to the Mountains of Mirkwood in the East, and from the ruins of Fornost Erain in the North to the fortress of Isengard in the South.\n\nPlayers can choose among several different races, each with some unique characteristics. The races are separated into three striving factions. Dwarves, Elves, Half-Elves, Hobbits and Men — among them are the shapeshifting Beornings — are eternally at war with the Orcs, Trolls and Black Númenóreans.

Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness, and untimely deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits -- and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well.\nFeaturing hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa: The Demon Blade transports players into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilizing their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Vanillaware"],"publishers":["Ignition Entertainment","Marvelous Entertainment","Rising Star Games"],"aggregated_rating":85.0,"release_date":1239235200,"platforms":["Wii","Wii U"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa7qa.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":129502,"name":"Muldulamulom","summary":"A surreal Metroidvania-style platformer made for Ludum Dare 40.","genres":["Platform","Indie"],"developers":["Mason Lindroth"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1512432000,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ugn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":21039,"name":"Mutant Mudds","summary":"Love pixels?

Continuing their policy of providing educational material that is both instructional and entertaining, the staffs of Scott, Foresman and Company and the Texas Instruments Learning Center expand their mathematics series to include the Multiplication 1 Solid State Software™ Command Module. The Multiplication 1 module shows your child the \"Magic of Multiplication\". It provides a strong foundation not only in the basic facts, but also in later work with larger numbers. Colorful graphics and lively music transform the learning of factors and products into an exciting experience — almost like magic! The Multiplication 1 module contains eight activities: \n- EQUAL GROUPS changes an addition problem into a multiplication problem using the concept of number grouping. \n- FACTORS 2 TO 5 explains horizontal multiplication problems for factors 2 through 5. \n- FACTORS 0 TO 5 demonstrates multiplication of a factor by 2, 1, and then 0 (zero). \n- FACTORS 6 TO 9 increases the multiplication skills to include the factors 6 to 9. \n- MULTIPLY ANOTHER WAY presents a smooth transition from the horizontal multiplication problem to the vertical problem. \n- HOW MANY IN ALL uses a random number of hats \"sprouting\" a random number of flowers to demonstrate solving for the product. \n- COMPLETE THE BOX provides one factor while your child selects the other and then solves for the missing number (the product of the two factors). \n- REVIEW THE FACTS offers 28 multiplication problems with factors 0 (zero) to 9. A stage is set complete with a magician and audience that stands up each time your child correctly answers the displayed problem. \n \nThe Multiplication 1 module advances your child to more difficult drills according to the number of correct responses given in each activity. The computer automatically advances to the next activity if your child answers 80 percent of the drill problems correctly. If less than 60 percent of the problems are answered correctly, the computer returns to the appropriate activity, providing your child with more practice. This automation helps alleviate anxieties caused by consistently incorrect responses, making the learning of mathematical skills a pleasurable and rewarding experience. With this module, Texas Instruments continues its tradition of applying innovative Solid State Speech™ technology to educational activities. Multiplication 1 is designed to work with or without the Texas Instruments Solid State Speech™ Synthesizer (sold separately). However, the Speech Synthesizer must be attached to activate the voice of the computer. The computer's voice then gives directions, reads the equations, and encourages your child to \"Try again\" when he or she gives an incorrect answer. The addition of speech strengthens the learning process since your child can hear, as well as see, the correct answers.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":344319,"name":"Mukogawa","summary":"The Takeuchi family have been the ones at charge of preserving the mysterious house, Mukogawa, for decades.

In case one happens to show up in your home: don’t ask for that poker game. That’s already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.\n\nIf you’re into TV series, then you’ll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan „Riker“ Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid „freezing“ of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.\n\nMultimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, it’s always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The program’s poker skill is mediocre; it’s playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.\n\nReady to join the game? On second thought, maybe you should wait for the fairy.","genres":[],"developers":["New World Computing"],"publishers":["New World Computing"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820368000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22y2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":154126,"name":"Mumbai Gullies","summary":"Come and experience a thrilling and exciting story based in Mumbai, the city of dreams!","genres":["Racing","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3pfh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":60989,"name":"Mutant Factions","summary":"Mutant Factions is a free top-down shooter that involves the use of skills to gain the upper hand on enemies and fulfilling objectives.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":322481,"name":"Mubosama","summary":"We were spending our usual summer—catching beetles, chasing dogs, finding good spots.

The game display 2D sprite-drawn boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called \"FreeCam\" 3D system), with the boxers moving around the ring in 360°.\n\nOne or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O. and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes: exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself.\n\nThere are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode, the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an uppercut.\n\nEach fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during the fight.\n\nThe game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali's voice.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":741484800,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9hqf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":201732,"name":"Music GunGun! 2","summary":"The 2nd installment of Taito's rhythm-shooting arcade game.","genres":["Shooter","Music","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito","Nex Entertainment"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1296086400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coawk7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":71543,"name":"Muppet Treasure Island","summary":"Muppet Treasure Island was a point-and-click adventure based on the film of the same name, based on the R.L.

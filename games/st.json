In the case of State of Decay 2, you throw a curveball. Although this is the 34th update for State of Decay 2, Curveball represents a significant overhaul. This new update, coming to players for free on September 18, is a landmark moment for the game – not just offering a swathe of new content for the game’s most dedicated players and newcomers alike, but marking a new era in State of Decay 2’s development through the work of Wushu Studios.\n\nWushu, from Liverpool, England, will continue providing support to State of Decay 2 as much of original studio Undead Labs transitions to work on the next entry in the series – but where you might expect that support to be incremental, Wushu is making a very big splash. Curveball is a major update, touching almost every element of the game, and designed to consistently offer brand new challenges, even to those who have been playing State of Decay 2 since release.\n\nAvailable after the fifth in-game day, curveballs can change the world around your settlement in some very interesting ways. Housed in a new menu, curveballs will periodically appear – each with their own narrative attached – offering new objectives, rewards, enemy types and much more. Curveballs can be positive (like finding increased loot) or negative (like buffing regular zombies in multiple ways); they can be timed or objective based; they can affect enemies, your survivors, or other NPCs. Effectively, any element of the game you may have gotten comfortable with can, and often will, change.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":["Wushu Studios"],"publishers":["Xbox Game Studios"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1694995200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7369.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":52764,"name":"SturmFront: The Mutant War - Übel Edition","summary":"Arcade action game in the vein of Commando, Ikari Warriors and Shock Troopers, mixed with bullet hell elements.

Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.\n\nStreet Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a \"double KO\" or \"draw game\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.\n\nAfter every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a \"bonus game\" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\n\nLike in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.\n\nStreet Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also \"cancel\" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":665366400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co55et.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":360774,"name":"Street Gods","summary":"Street Gods is a physical VR action rogue-lite set in a shattered New York City where the Nine Realms of Norse myth have crashed into the modern world.

It's set against backdrops of fully-realized 3D environments, where the beauty of space becomes an integral part of player immersion, setting Starminer apart as a visually stunning and technologically advanced space base-building game. Starminer is built with realism and immersion as core design pillars through the incorporation of Newtonian physics for propulsion and movement. This not only adds a layer of authenticity and complexity to the gameplay but also introduces a rewarding learning curve for players seeking a genuinely advanced spacefaring experience.\n\nIn Starminer, the universe is more than just a pretty backdrop for exploration and conquest—it's a playground for players to explore their creativity and long-term ambitions for their fleets. Central to the game's creative ethos is the ability to design a variety of space stations that bring them toward their goals; whether it's to mine resources, be a defensive power, colonization, energy production, or something else entirely. The dynamic and customizable nature of these different types of stations means that the player doesn’t only decide what their cosmic empire will be; it will become a unique reflection of their strategic prowess and imaginative flair.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["Cool and Good Games"],"publishers":["Paradox Arc"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8ba1.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":35690,"name":"Star Horizon","summary":"Experience fast action, thrilling levels, spectacular explosions and lots of pew-pew-pew.

Part of Blizzard's StarCraft series, the game was announced on September 20, 2002, and was to be developed by Nihilistic Software for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. Several delays in development caused Blizzard to move back the release date and the game has not yet materialized. Nihilistic Software ceded development to Swingin' Ape Studios in 2004 before Blizzard bought the company, and plans for the GameCube version were cancelled in 2005.\n\nBlizzard announced in March 2006 that the game was put on \"indefinite hold\" while the company investigated seventh generation video game console possibilities. Subsequent public statements from company personnel had been contradictory about whether production was to be renewed or planned story elements worked into other products. The continued delay of Ghost had caused it to be labeled as vaporware, and it was ranked fifth in Wired News‍'​ annual Vaporware Awards in 2005. In 2014, Blizzard president Mike Morhaime confirmed that Ghost was officially cancelled.\n\nUnlike its real-time strategy predecessor StarCraft, Ghost is a third-person shooter, and was intended to give players a closer and more personal view of the StarCraft universe. Following Nova, a Terran psychic espionage operative called a \"ghost\", the game is set four years after the conclusion of StarCraft: Brood War and covers a conspiracy about a secretive military project conducted by Nova's superiors in the imperial Terran Dominion. Very little of the game's storyline has been released; however, in November 2006 after the game's postponement, a novel was published called StarCraft Ghost: Nova, which covers the backstory of the central character.","genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"developers":["Nihilistic Software","Blizzard Entertainment","Swingin' Ape Studios"],"publishers":["Blizzard Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Xbox","Nintendo GameCube","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2wby.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":333430,"name":"Starfell","summary":"Starfell is a combo-builder turn-based combat roguelike game with a unique astrology theme.

Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.[1][2]\n\nThe game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This took the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and required the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game involved the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay was further enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state.

A primary goal of the project is to fill a gap between game creation tools like Bloxels and more advanced tools like Game Maker Studio. \n \nWith StageMechanic you are not just playing a game someone else made - you have the opportunity to create your own game and to learn from and build on games that others create. \n \nFor the casual aspiring creator, we offer a range of pre-made blocks and characters with different mechanics and creator-defined properties. \nIntermediate level creators can use the built-in Lua interpreter and code editor to modify all of the built in blocks, items, and characters and even create their own original mechanics. In the future users will also be able to easily import their own 3D models create in tools like MagicaVoxel and Tinkercad as well as create their own music, sound effects, etc. \n \nAdvanced users have full acess to the project's C# source code, allowing for infinite custamizability. As a professionally engineered and developed non-trivial project, StageMechanic offers a unique chance for students to move beyond tutorials and get hands on experience in a complex real-world game. \n \nAI Researchers \n \nFuture versions of StageMechanic will include both the Encog neural network library and TensorFlow accessable via the built-in Lua interpreter and code editor, allowing real-time AI experimentation. \n \n2D tile-based game-creation tool users \n \nUsers of game-creation tools like Super Mario Maker and Bloxels will find many of the same concepts in StageMechanic. You can create your own levels using the built-in level editor, play your own levels, share your levels, and play levels created by others. \nUnlike these games, StageMechanic is in 3D space and includes the possibility to script custom game mechanics - allowing for much more complex games. The built-in block and item types helps keep things simple for those just getting started. \n \nGame Developers \n \nStageMechanic is BSD licensed allowing anyone to create their own open-source or commercial games based on our engine.

The player controls Hiryu himself, whose main weapon is a tonfa-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.\n\nNumerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These includes an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name: 飛 and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji 竜, the second character in Hiryu's name), an extra life, and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.[3] Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk, known individually as Option A, B and C respectively.\n\nThe game has five stages: the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (called \"St. Petersburg\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog (געלראב), the Amazonian Jungle, and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions. Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It's Game Over when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.","genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom","Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom","U.S. Gold","Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":604713600,"platforms":["Arcade","Sharp X68000","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Wii","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga","Wii U","PlayStation","Amstrad CPC","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ijs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":298182,"name":"Stellaris: Season 08","summary":"Stellaris: Season 08 includes \"The Machine Age\", a new expansion from Paradox Development Studios, \"Cosmic Storms\", a new mechanical expansion and \"The Grand Archive Story Pack\"!","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Paradox Development Studio"],"publishers":["Paradox Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1712793600,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8tqb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":142410,"name":"Stream Quest","summary":"Stream Quest is a Twitch-chat controlled RPG designed for Streamers to run either alongside other games, during breaks of longer streams or along with their viewers (either competitively or collaboratively!)","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Richard Stamp"],"publishers":["Richard Stamp"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1611273600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2rgc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":19204,"name":"Star Ruler 2: Wake of the Heralds","summary":"The Heralds have come to the galaxy of Star Ruler 2.

The world is navigated using an overworld map using point-to-point navigation, with a date system showing the length of time it takes to get to a selected location. Alongside the story missions, Towns can be visited, in which characters can customize and create new weapons and armor, sell existing equipment in exchange for money, and shop for items such as healing potions. In camps set up on a journey, characters can swap out weapons and armor, equip items such as healing potions and beneficial charms for future battles. Special items used in character leveling can also be crafted by the player. Alongside story-based missions, there is a special dungeon called the Catacomb of Trials, where characters can battle and gain experience levels, raising their general statistics. The number of available levels in the Catacomb increases as players progress through the game. Each character has a specific character class, which they keep throughout the game and continue to level up as they gain experience points (XP). Higher amounts of XP are awarded for executing special abilities. Along with swordsmen and archers, there are alchemists (mages), priests (healers), and units who fight using most things from axes to fists.\n\nMost battles are triggered based on story events, and are completed when the stated object has been accomplished by the player, be it defeating all enemies, defeating a boss, or performing a specific task. At the end of each battle, the players gain a summery of their performance and spoils gained. The game uses the turn-based Replaceable Action Position battle system, much of which was carried over from the battle system used in Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth. Players navigate the field across a grid-based map, which can include obstacles such as bodies of water and high structures. Character positioning within the environment can be used to their advantage, such as an archer gaining higher accuracy when at a high point in the level. Character actions are arranged in a set order, and each character's weapon dictates their attack range. Each time a character performs an action, they gain experience points and additional Skill Points (SP) that can be used to purchase supplies or raise individual character stats. Three types of Skills can be equipped for characters: Action Skills, a special attack that player execute for a certain amount of Magic Points (MP); Support Skills, which grant passive abilities such as scaling higher obstacles; and Zone Skills, which grant passive abilities to both the equipped character and those in close proximity to them.\n\nAlongside Action Skills, two or more characters in conjunction trigger unique special moves called Team Attacks. The amount of damage done depends on how many characters took part in the action. Team attacks also increase the rewards gained at the end of battles. Characters' actions are governed by their stored Action Points (AP): a character's turn begins when their AP meter is at 100. A character's actions can continue until the meter reaches 0, meaning that they can move and attack multiple times within their turn. The amount of AP used with each action depends on the weight of the armor the character is wearing.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Tactical"],"developers":["Atlus"],"publishers":["Atlus","505 Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1098921600,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5078.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":53663,"name":"Star Wars Battlefront: Ultimate Edition","summary":"The Star Wars Battlefront: Ultimate Edition has everything fans need to live out their Star Wars battle fantasies.

It was developed by LucasArts using the Unreal Engine, and published for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows in 2005. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes. In the story, set in the Star Wars Legends expanded universe, players assume the role of RC-1138 (\"Boss\"), an elite clone trooper, known as \"clone commando\", and the leader of the special ops unit Delta Squad, consisting of three fellow clone commandos with distinctive personalities and character traits: RC-1262 (\"Scorch\"), RC-1140 (\"Fixer\"), and RC-1207 (\"Sev\"). The story follows Delta Squad as they complete increasingly difficult missions throughout the Clone Wars and learn to bond as a team.\n\nRepublic Commando received generally favorable reviews at release. Many critics praised the story and combat, but criticized the short length and average multiplayer. In the years since its release, it has come to be considered one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and has gained a cult following.\n\nAn enhanced port of the game by Aspyr is set to release for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 6, 2021.

Otherwise, it's the same game. And though the flaws in its gameplay are only more noticeable now 16 years later, this remaster manages to still deliver a compelling story of four specialized commandos engaging in a variety of combat missions across the Clone Wars.\".","genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["LucasArts"],"publishers":["Activision","LucasArts","Electronic Arts","Aspyr Media"],"aggregated_rating":80.8,"release_date":1108598400,"platforms":["Xbox","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2au4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":348306,"name":"Stars of Icarus","summary":"Assemble your crew and take to the stars in a team-based PvP dogfight.

The game takes place a few centuries before the original Star Ocean (around S.D. 10, or approximately 2087 AD). The game's plot revolves around Edge and his crew combating a mysterious threat called the \"Grigori\".\n\nAn international version of the game was released by Square Enix as a worldwide PlayStation 3-exclusive on February 9, 2010. Officially known as Star Ocean: The Last Hope International, the game contains both Japanese and English voices as well as new content that is exclusive to the international version of the game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["tri-Ace","Square Enix Product Development Division 10"],"publishers":["Square Enix"],"aggregated_rating":77.2,"release_date":1235001600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2rem.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":10889,"name":"StarDrive","summary":"StarDrive sets a new benchmark for the ‘4X Space Strategy’ genre.

Mankind has colonized the solar system and two political entities have emerged: the Alliance consisting of American, Australian, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British and German forces, and The Coalition of Russian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern interests. The game begins with a surprise attack on Fort Kennedy, where a peace treaty turns into a bloodbath: all of the inner four planets are overrun, including Terra herself, and the Italian and French fleets are utterly lost. The Alliance fleet regroups at Triton, Neptune's moon, and attempts to regain lost territory. The player takes the role of a rookie pilot in the international 45th Volunteers squadron, under the command of Captain Robert Foster and Wing Commander Maria Enriquez, aboard the re-commissioned British carrier ANS Reliant.\n\nAs with Wing Commander: Prophecy, the pilot's flying ability is the only meter by which success and failure is measured, though Starlancer does not feature as many branching mission paths. As in Wing Commander I the pilot may be promoted throughout the course of the campaign; unlike WCI, their rank determines which fighters and missiles they may choose to employ during each mission. The game provides a \"virtual carrier\" through which to navigate, including nearby crewmembers whose reaction to you depends on your current rank and standing. However, the true gem of the game lies in its textual and video news broadcasts, which keep the player informed as to the status of the rest of the war, which seems to be progressing just over the horizon. Players frequently find themselves flying alongside squadrons and pilots they have heard about on the news just recently, providing a dose of 'celebrity exposure' and also increasing the sensation that they are just one part of a much larger war effort.\n\nStarlancer's story is continued in Chris Roberts' Freelancer project, though the two belong to different subgenres (the first is purely focused on action, the latter also features trading and the player can freely move through the game's universe when they are not on a mission.)","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Digital Anvil","Warthog PLC"],"publishers":["Microsoft Game Studios"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":954460800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jps.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"5118","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/StarLancer"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"5584","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-5584/"}]},{"igdb_id":273261,"name":"Stronghold","summary":"More compact than my other maps, both in size and monster count, focusing on making an interconnected layout and more difficult encounters.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1697760000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":88463,"name":"Star Clash","summary":"Star Clash is a small space shooting game.

It was released by Exidy in 1979. Star Fire is a first-person space shooter where your mission is to seek out and destroy enemy spacecraft while avoiding incoming missiles.\n\nIf a number of elements of Star Fire seem similar to Star Wars, your eyes are not deceiving you. Star Fire was originally designed as a Star Wars game, with the eventual hope that either a license would be purchased or that they would change enough of the elements to avoid any legal entanglements. Originally, the authors had hoped that Midway would pick up the game for distribution, but they passed and instead Exidy purchased the game and released it.\n\nStar Fire was the first game to come in an environmental cabinet, designed by Michael Cooper-Hart. Even more importantly from a historical perspective, Star Fire was the first game to keep a high score list where the player could enter his or her initials. Prior games had tracked the concept of a high score, but Star Fire was the first to let you personalize the high score entry and display a top ten list with your initials next to your high score.\n\nAn update to Star Fire, simply called \"Star Fire II\", was intended to go into the last run of Star Fire units. It features a more refined high score display and easier high score input.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Technical Magic"],"publishers":["Exidy","Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":297043200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/myseuevgbpm2bf0nxvjn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":290164,"name":"Star Wars: Rebel Warrior","summary":"An unreleased Star Wars game which would’ve had the player taking on the role of a Wookie fighting the Imperial Forces.

The game places emphasis on racing on stunt tracks and features a track editor, it is clearly influenced by the earlier arcade game Hard Drivin' and has many similar elements to the game Stunt Driver which was released around the same time.\n\nIn Stunts, players race a lap around the circuit, with the aim of completing the lap as quickly as possible without crashing. However, these laps often feature special track areas such as loops, jumps (including over tall buildings), slalom roads and corkscrews. The game area is restricted by a large fixed size square area defined and surrounded by a fence which the game is designed to prevent the player from leaving. Players can either race against the clock or choose between six different opponents; there is no support for real-time multiplayer. Stunts features 11 different drivable cars, with either automatic or manual transmission. Replays of races can be saved and reviewed. There are four camera views available during replay and actual driving, and the dashboard is an optional overlay on all views. It is also possible to continue the race from any point in the replay, however the time for that race will not be recorded. Another major feature of the game is the built-in track and terrain editor which allows the user to design arbitrary new tracks or modifications of existing tracks.[2]\n\nThe cars can drive on paved roads, gravel roads, icy/snow roads, and grass if driving off the track — which all offer different levels of grip. The game has a relatively advanced pseudo-physics engine for its time which can simulate oversteer and understeer, grip is also proportional to the banking of a curve. The game features a 3D engine with flat shading and no textures, it uses polygonal graphics for most objects, including trees and road signs, there are few sprites. The resolution is 320×200 with 256 colors. There is an option to select high and low detail. The game is written for DOS and executes in real mode.[3]\n\nStunts includes a form of copy protection. Each time after running the program, players must complete a specific phrase found in the game manual before being allowed to race. If the player fails to complete the phrase three times, the next race will still load. However, approximately four seconds into the race, the player is informed that he or she did not deactivate the car's security system, the car crashes, and the player is returned to the main menu.","genres":["Racing","Sport"],"developers":["Distinctive Software"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts Victor","Mindscape","Brøderbund Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","DOS","FM Towns","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25bu.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"14591","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Stunts"}]},{"igdb_id":247733,"name":"Stop the Crawl","summary":"Stop the Crawl is half dungeon crawler, half tower defense.

On their way, the players will meet many peculiar characters, learn their stories and try to help with their problems whenever an opportunity presents itself.\n\nAdditionally, this port is somewhat more ‘mature’ if such a term could be used, due to its sense of humor and the depiction of alcohol. This version of the game is quite different from the Mega Drive port that is already available in English, but it’s similar to the original PC-88 release as far the mechanics are concerned (except for the character portraits and some other minor details). An interesting aspect of the game are the shops, which were not present in the MD port. There, just the equipment can be found, as the entire money system was scrapped. In the PC versions the players would get money for the missions instead, which in turn would allow them to buy better gear and additional resources.\n\nThe main story beats are the same, but there are many differences as far as the characters and events go, which gives this version its own identity. In fact, this is what makes the game quite different from the MD port in particular. For example, the final area in this version is massive, whereas in the MD port it was much smaller.

There are no monthly charges and no premium features that are restricted to players who register a paid account.\n\nThe game is player driven, all roles - from the emperor or commander of the Rebel Alliance to the fighter pilots - are open for player characters. Combat is not implemented yet, but the player driven economy offers many options to mine, trade or build cities, facilities and stations.\n\nAny new player can create their individual character selecting from various skills and more than 50 different races from Star Wars (Wookies, Twi'leks etc). They can then join an existing group - from the infamous Empire to less famous smaller production, trading or even pirate groups - and later found their own company.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 planets that can be explored and colonised. Player characters can own their own ships, vehicles, buildings, cities or even companies. Also player groups (\"factions\") can be owners of anything, setting the Star Wars Combine apart from alliances and guilds in many other similar games.\n\nThe Star Wars Combine offers many roles to choose from and thus allows the player to not only live their own dream of being whatever they want in the Star Wars universe, but also to adapt the game to their favoured style of play, playing the game as more of an adventure, a strategy game, a business sim, or just enjoying the lively community of like minded gamers and Star Wars fans.\n\nDespite the current lack of combat the Star Wars Combine offers a complexity and variety rather unusual for free browser games.

The game is considered the platform's killer app. It was later ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari ST.\n\nThe game simulates 3D space combat between the player's ship and an invading fleet of alien \"Zylon\" vessels. Star Raiders was distinctive for its graphics, which, in addition to various map and long range scan views, provided forward and aft first-person views, with movement conveyed by a streaming 3D starfield as the player engaged enemy spacecraft.\n\nWhile there had already been target-shooting games using the first person perspective (including 1978's Cosmic Conflict), Star Raiders had considerably higher quality visuals and more complex gameplay. It inspired imitators throughout the 1980s as well as later-generation space combat simulation games including Elite, Wing Commander, and Star Wars: X-Wing.\n\nIn 2007, Star Raiders was included in a list of the 10 most important video games of all time, as compiled by Stanford University's History of Science and Technology Collections.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator"],"developers":["Atari"],"publishers":["Atari Corporation","Atari"],"aggregated_rating":27.5,"release_date":320716800,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit","Atari ST/STE","Atari 5200"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co38t3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"730","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-730/"}]},{"igdb_id":293118,"name":"Streamer Life Simulator 2","summary":"In the second game of the series, competition has increased and now everyone wants to be a streamer.

Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal mecha known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.\nHumanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun's policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from Mercury to Titan. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military's elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.\nThe inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien \"Tharsis Cache\"; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.\nThe Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.\nThe game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator"],"developers":["Dynamix"],"publishers":["Sierra On-Line"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":922233600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2v9m.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":320744,"name":"Star Ronin","summary":"Star Ronin is a top-down action-adventure game set in the far future.

The larger ships have cloaking devices which make them invisible. Damage is inflicted on ships when they are shot or rammed by other ships.\n\nUniquely for the time, the player vessel remains locked in the centre of the screen and the world rotates and moves around it. Player shots also have limited range and are subject to the same rotation as everything else, which means the player needs to predict where shots will need to go in order to hit the enemies. The ship has both long range scanners and shields but may only use one at a time. By default, the game will automatically switch between them based on the proximity of enemy vessels but the player can optionally take full control.\n\nUsing shields, thrusting, turning and firing all use up energy which is also depleted when hit by enemies. Energy will automatically replenish, most quickly if the shields are off and the starship is not moving, but this leaves the player open to attack.\n\nUnusually, the player is never expected to return their ship from the frontiers. Each individual voyage is a separate command, and lasts either until the player's vessel is destroyed or until they use an escape capsule. If the escape capsule is successfully launched, which means firing it so that it doesn't collide with any enemy ships, and the player is judged by Star-Fleet to have killed enough enemies during his command then he is given a new commission and a new and visually different ship. 8 points are scored for a small ship and 12 for a large ship. Starfleet's opinion of the player's performance ranges from them being \"furious\" to \"delighted\". The number of points required to reach the next level is not fixed. Sometimes a score of 60 will suffice and sometimes a score of 80 will not be enough to guarantee automatic promotion to the next level, assuming the escape capsule was jettisoned safely. Strangely, more points were awarded when an escape capsule collided with and destroyed an enemy ship as opposed to being shot or colliding with the starship.\n\nLater commands take place in faster environments and with greater numbers of enemy. There are 8 different starship designs, which repeat after level 8.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Acornsoft Limited"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":441676800,"platforms":["BBC Microcomputer System","Acorn Electron"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n9dooqu6pjloz4gshkis.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":54649,"name":"Star Wars","summary":"This game is based entirely on the first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of Luke Skywalker, driving the landspeeder across Tatooine in search of R2-D2.\n\nLuke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the \"Cantina Band\" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.\n\nThe player eventually lands on the Death Star and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape. The game also features first person segments of piloting the Millenium Falcon through that Asteroid field that was once Alderaan, and shooting down Tie Fighters in both the Millenium Falcon and an X-Wing fighter. The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown.\n\nThe game featured the characters Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO.

Gameplay is presented mostly in first person cockpit view, which is achieved with surprisingly good effect given the 2600's primitive graphics capabilities. The starfighter carries laser weapons, shields, and a faster-than-light drive. The fighter also carries a limited energy supply, which is drained by firing the lasers, being hit by enemy fire, warping, or simply flying around. If the ship's energy drops to zero it is destroyed, and the game ends. Enemy fire can knock out the fighter's subsystems (such as weapons) on top of draining energy. The game \"universe\" is a square-shaped galaxy mapped into a grid of 36 sectors. Each sector can be home to some enemy ships, a starbase, both, or nothing. The player \"warps\" the fighter to a sector to engage enemy ships; once they are all destroyed, the player moves on to another. The player can also warp to a sector with a starbase, and dock with it (a rather tricky process) to replenish energy and repair damaged subsystems. Enemy ships in turn maneuver through the galaxy as they home in to destroy the starbases. The game is won when all enemy ships are destroyed, or lost if either the player's fighter or all four starbases are destroyed.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Activision"],"publishers":["Activision","Polyvox"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/unsqsl9ojtpbetjesm6m.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":298894,"name":"Star Scandal","summary":"As a newbie photojournalist, the glittering world of the rich and famous seems impossibly out of reach, but all that is about to change.

Pieces come in three colors: red, yellow, and blue. Pieces commonly have a star on one end, or occasionally, a star on two ends. The aim of the game is to clear blocks from the playing field, by matching stars from same-coloured blocks. Players are rewarded for creating combos (which are called 'links') of piece clearances. The game ends when someone's piece level reaches the top of the playfield and is not cleared after three seconds. The one player 'story' mode revolves around moving around an island and playing against opponents who gradually become harder, and consists of playing against 9 opponents (although this can be adjusted). There are also activities that involve the player concentrating on a specific task within a time limit. These include getting a high score, a high number of links, surviving for as long as possible, and clearing a field in a short time.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Axela"],"publishers":["Namco Limited"],"aggregated_rating":72.0,"release_date":883526400,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9bcb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":283734,"name":"Strength & Skill: Guiness Book of Records","summary":"Strength & Skill: Guiness Book of Records was produced by Sun/Kitco in 1984.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Sun Electronics"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":473299200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7nzo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":296991,"name":"Street Girls","summary":"This game is a classic memory game with several levels of difficulty and beautiful art.

You can decide you if you want to play a Friendly match (for a short game), Practice (the best way for rookies to learn how to play), and competitions (where you get different options, like Championship, league, Knockout and world cup).\n\nIn the main menu you also have the options to edit teams! Yes you can edit your country name, and can put in your favorite names for the players on your team, an option that very few games offered at that time. You can also change the colors of your team’s uniforms, and choose the best tactic (to play in a 4-2-2 or 3-5-2 formation and such). You can even change the face of your players. Fantastic, isn’t it?! And another great option of this game is that all players have their unique statistics. But the possibilities don’t end here. You even get to choose between an indoor and a traditional outdoor tournament. The indoor tournaments (as you may know) are actually a whole different game of soccer. The ball can never be out of the field, your players run faster, and there are many more differences that make separate this game from the traditional game.\n\nYou can play with comments, like the British style that you can see on TV, and with or without music. You can define the time for every match (it can be between 2 and 10 minutes) and you can play either with the keyboard, or with a joystick.\n\nThe graphics are good for the time of game’s release, at the same style is similar to Vr Soccer, they use a 3D environment, that gives you more realistic movements of the players, which gives a more realistic feel while playing soccer.

It's pretty much a straight knock off of platformers like Sonic, but it does so with charm, personality, and bags of entertainment. The story revolves around the adventures of a little blue hedgehog (Sonic's sister perhaps?) and finds her travelling through an array of colorful environments, although it's not entirely clear why this should be necessary. In classic platform fashion, she runs around, leaps a bit and dashes at the many enemies which litter her path. In similar style to the Kirby games, you can absorb the power of defeated enemies which comes in handy during later stages, while you can also throw rocks at the bad guys a la Super Mario Bros 2. There are also Sonic-style springboards and the environments you travel through are your standard cutesy platformer-type levels. Adventures of Sting is certainly not shy about where it gets its inspiration from but while this criminal lack of originality has killed many other games in the past, here it seems to work to its advantage and actually results in a curiously enjoyable little title. The game gets off to a great start with its lush visuals which are just bursting with color and personality and with some lovely environments to discover. The controls are easy to pick up, while the platforming itself is largely entertaining and although not overly challenging, maybe this isn't such a big deal.

Even though its success was mostly expressed in the spreading of bootlegs in China, Afega still claimed to have exported more than 10,000 machines. In Korea, the game was originally published before the summer vacation of 1997, but called back for some reason, and not sold again until November the same year. At first sales were slow because of the low machine price of 250,000 Won (which lead arcade owners assume low quality), but after word-of-mouth had spread, the game became a hit in its home country, too6. \n \nWhile it didn't bring anything new on the shmup table, Red Hawk's biggest strength was its bombastic arsenal, throwing together all kinds of weapon systems that are seen in the genre. Besides the highly upgradeable standard weapon, planes can charge for a devastating, screen filling special attack. Those don't replace smart bombs, though, as those are available, too. Finally, there's a number of sattelites to further boost fire power. All weapons are unique for each of the four different pilots, too. \n \nThe game originally used an upright monitor, but for some reason some of the European releases swapped the horizontal and vertical resolution around for ordinary display orientation. This makes the game noticably harder, as enemies are seen later. In Japan, the game was distributed as Stagger I (with the upright screen resolution).","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":854755200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sqlfr80px4d8h6xmrho4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":310853,"name":"Streetball Fury","summary":"Streetball Fury is a fast paced mix of street basketball and brawling pixel art game, with unique characters, maps and cool tunes.

The enemy units are not very intelligent, but they use their own special abilities like splitting acid and are very powerful. There is a wide range of enemies, from simple close-range fighters to suicide units, artillery bugs and even human soldiers. The mission objectives are also different. From simple hunting missions up to escorts or the capturing of bugs.\n\nThe game also have a RPG part. Surviving soldiers gain experience points for each killed bug / destroyed bug holes. By and by the soldiers increase their states and acquire higher ranks. Better battle suits (armor) and stronger weapons are only available for soldiers with high ranks.

Players create their own character by customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class.

Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["BioWare Edmonton"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":90.2,"release_date":1257206400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2mvs.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"xbox36066acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108c0","url":"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Dragon-Age-Origins/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108c0"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"BS9SX4Q6XJRF","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/-1-/BS9SX4Q6XJRF"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"17450","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/17450"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108c0","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/Dragon-Age-Origins/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802454108c0"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"20738","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-20738/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"18958","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dragon%20Age%E2%84%A2:%20Origins"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"BS9SX4Q6XJRF","url":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/dragon-age-origins/BS9SX4Q6XJRF"}]},{"igdb_id":77,"name":"Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening","summary":"Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening is the only expansion for Dragon Age: Origins.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure"],"developers":["Square Enix Business Division 8"],"publishers":["Square Enix"],"aggregated_rating":0.0,"release_date":1258588800,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","Nintendo 3DS","Android","iOS","Legacy Mobile Device","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1xaj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":1815,"name":"Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen","summary":"Embark on a journey to explore the land, seas and skies of the Dragon Quest universe in this grand entry from the Zenithia Trilogy.

The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field.

There are four different power-ups, each of which provides a different weapon to the dragon. Collecting multiple power-ups of the same colour makes that weapon more powerful. The dragon changes colour depending upon which power-up has been collected. Red enables the dragon to breathe a flame. The flame gets longer if more power-ups are collected. Yellow enables the dragon's body to fire crescents in all directions. White enables the dragon to produce up to four miniature dragons, which home in on enemies.

As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...\n\nThe player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield, each with their own magic powers. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Cavia","Square Enix Product Development Division 10"],"publishers":["Take-Two Interactive","Square Enix"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1063238400,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4agx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11663,"name":"Drakengard 2","summary":"Drakengard 2 is a direct sequel to the original Drakengard: the story revolves around Nowe, a boy raised by the dragon Legna, fighting against a tyrannical faction of Knights, encountering characters from the previous game and becoming entangled in the fate of the world.\n\nLike the original, Drakengard 2 combines on-foot hack and slash with aerial combat stages and RPG game mechanics.

While in dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again. \nAs the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player's outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon's fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health. \nThere are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end.

It also introduced the scouter, which allowed players to look up the stats of other characters in the game, as well as basic information about them. The game also introduced charged melee attacks, which allowed characters to unleash a powerful physical strike after a short charging period.

The game is played with touch controls on a 7x7 square grid. In each round, the player places a disc that falls from the top of the grid. Each disc has a number 1-7, or a blank. Whenever the number of any disc matches the number of contiguous discs in a row or column, that disc disappears and also hits any blank discs it touches. When a blank is hit twice, it turns into a numbered disc. After a number of turns, the round ends and a full row of blank discs emerges from the bottom of the grid.

Well, mainly it was just the usual dungeon exterminator's subterranean grind: killing off thousands of roaches, chopping through tar, guzzling mimic potions, and generally ridding the King's underground chambers of all that should not be there. But also Beethro met an unexpected enemy, created lifelong grudges against him, and learned secrets that would later motivate his journey to Rooted Hold.\n\nDROD: Journey to Rooted Hold\nSwordplay and puzzles combine in this thinking man's dungeon crawl. It's simple to learn, with just a handful of commands to master. But the unique gameplay provides an amazing depth. A detailed overhead view shows monsters, obstacles, and other game elements. You have as much time as you like to contemplate your next move. So this is a good game for relaxing, but also terrifically involving once you get started. You'll be hooked by the story of Beethro and his troublesome nephew, Halph. Our heroes set off on a harmless jaunt, but end up far below the surface, chased by a clownish madman. They begin to uncover a vast, underground bureaucracy, and things only get stranger the further they delve. You've got over 350 rooms ahead--each one a singular challenge for you to conquer.\n\nDROD: The City Beneath\nYou begin as a rather ugly man named \"Beethro\" who travels deep beneath the ground. There are other people down there too, citizens of a mysterious \"Rooted Empire\", that are carving tunnels and building things. Beethro just wants to know why, but it's hard to get a useful answer. He was always fond of saying \"there is no problem that can't be solved with a really big sword,\" but upon arriving at the underground capital, Beethro is startled to find that nobody seems interested in attacking him. No, for some reason, they would rather persuade him to stand in a very long line.\n25 sprawling levels with over 350 custom designed rooms, including secret rooms.\n17 types of monsters with greatly varying abilities and behavior.\n11 different characters, some of which contribute to puzzles as well as story development.","genres":["Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1112313600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2q2q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":124940,"name":"Dracula Trilogy","summary":null,"genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3cyw.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1207659251","url":"https://www.gog.com/en/game/dracula_trilogy"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1394112814","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dracula%20Trilogy"}]},{"igdb_id":125467,"name":"Dredgers","summary":"Based on traditional rogue-likes, Dredgers is a real-time dungeon crawler where you can play as 30 different races, each having their own stats and skills.

Various blocks appear slowly from the top. If one of the columns would reach the bottom, the game is over.\n\nThe player has a cursor at the bottom which can be used to select a particular column, pull blocks into that cursor the bottom, move the cursor to a different column and push the blocks back to the top. Multiple blocks can be moved at once, but they have to be the same type. As soon as the column of at least 5 blocks of the same type gathers together, this group annihilates, freeing up space on the playfield, thus making it possible to continue the game.\n\nDrop-Drop was initially developed and published in Russia; the only known names attached to the project are programmers Vladimir Ryshov and Grigory Sragovich. The game was included in the Moscow Nights game compilation, which released in (at the very least) the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nData East learned of Moscow Knights and obtained a license for Drop-Drop, using it as the basis of what would eventually be known as Magical Drop. Both the first Magical Drop and Magical Drop II state that the gameplay was licensed from Russ Ltd, and Japanese materials for the first Magical Drop and its ports play up the game's status as a Russian puzzle game. At some point, Data East would purchase the full rights to the game from Russ; this is likely the reason why Russ is not credited in Magical Drop III or beyond.","genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle"],"developers":["Russ, Ltd."],"publishers":["Xor - Laboratory"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725760000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3u29.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":170886,"name":"Dream Golf VR: Infinity Towers","summary":"With this expansion, you can play an all new 18 hole mini golf course!

Unlike most Hummer Team games, it is in full Japanese as opposed to English. The story was completely removed from this version. However, the Arcade, Versus and CPU vs CPU modes are present. The characters are fought in a random order, and are always fought on certain stages.\n\nThe graphics and music are taken from the original game and simplified, with some characters sharing stages. Many of the stages themselves use multi-layered scrolling. The forest stage's theme, which is Bojack's theme from the original game, was reused in Tekken 2, another game by Hummer Team.

Players have the ability to hire new recruits, buy potions and distribute artifacts obtained in battles between fights. Each unit can be outfitted with one artifact and two potions. In addition to common units the player's army can include up to three unique heroes.\n\nAlmost every environment object is interactive – one can chop down a tree, set it on fire, or even turn it into an ally using magic. Each unit has its own action points which can be spent for any action – movements, attacks, spells or active skills. The player can randomly move units during his turn.\n\nThe in-game campaign editor lets you create custom campaigns, as a series of linked battles, with story text and customized rewards. You can save these campaigns a single file in order to easily share them.\n\nWith each unit the player has to make important tactical and strategic decisions. There is no need to remember a great number of each units properties or make complicated calculations – the player should rely on their personal assessment of the current situation.

On the ground, Caim's moves include sword combos with a finishing blow, blocking, jumping, a dash attack and a dragon attack.

You have to take out all incoming enemies and projectiles with fireballs and destructive spells or use the escape move for tricky situations. The game also incorporates some RPG elements: you gain experience by defeating enemies. These points can be used to level up, rendering attacks more powerful and expanding the maximum amount of health. Additional experience points are based on a time bonus and the stage score.\n\nAlthough the story of the original game is only vaguely mentioned, all missions have an introduction explaining your mission and the setting.

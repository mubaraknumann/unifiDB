The gameplay of DOA2, and all subsequent Dead or Alive games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds.The other defining feature of DOA2, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. In DOA2 many attacks upon hitting will inflict a stun on the opponent. While stunned, the opponent cannot attack, and cannot guard, but they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage.","genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"developers":["Team NINJA"],"publishers":["Tecmo"],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":940032000,"platforms":["Arcade","Dreamcast","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6t3o.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":1389,"name":"Dead or Alive 3","summary":"Dead or Alive 3 is the third installment in the popular fighting series Dead or Alive.

The scenario objective is for each team to destroy the opponents' Ancient, heavily guarded structures at opposing corners of the map. Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied heroes and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games, players level up their heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission.\n\nThe scenario was developed with the \"World Editor\" of Reign of Chaos, and was updated upon the release of its expansion, The Frozen Throne. There have been many variations of the original concept; the most popular being DotA Allstars, which eventually was simplified to DotA with the release of version 6.68. This specific scenario has been maintained by several authors during development, the latest of whom is the anonymous developer known as \"IceFrog\" who has developed the game since 2005.\n\nSince its original release, DotA has become a feature at several worldwide tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon and the Asian World Cyber Games, as well as the Cyberathlete Amateur and CyberEvolution leagues; in a 2008 article of video game industry website Gamasutra, the article's author claimed that DotA was probably \"the most popular and most-discussed free, non-supported game mod in the world\". DotA is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena genre.

The studio is known for developing games that include exceptionally well crafted puzzles and a wacky sense of humor which frequently breaks the fourth wall and plays to a wide assortment of offbeat puns. Moreover, the company has emerged with a winning streak of fantasy and sci-fi games based on popular literature adaptations. The most famous of these are Frederick Pohl's Gateway and Terry Brooks' Shannara.\n\nIn 1994, Legend Entertainment has chosen to adapt not 1 book but the whole series of 7 books by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman known as The Death Gate Cycle. The original release of the game even includes a special gift for fans of the book series, namely an exclusive short story written by the same authors that tells some of the history of the mysterious Assassin's Guild from the series.\n\nIn Death Gate, the player is cast in the role of a freshly freed Patryn—a young, brave wizard named Haplo. By his deeds in the Labyrinth, he has gained Xar's trust to be sent as a scout to the other 4 realms. The way between them leads through a mystical portal known as the Death Gate. For his journey, Haplo is handed not a single but several quests to complete. He must first explore the realms, learn about the new lands, and find the pieces of the World Seal that will allow the reformation of the world to its original whole. He must also retrieve as much of forgotten magical lore as he can, and find runes that will allow him to enter all the other realms. Finally, and most importantly, he must find out what has happened to the Sartan who seem to have vanished somewhere long ago, so that Xar will be able to bring them to the proper Patryn justice.\n\nThe game, by taking inspiration from the first 4 books, creates a certain unique experience for the player that stands out among other fantasy adventures. There is an unusually layered structure based on the initial premise of the 5 separate realms, since the consequences of the sundering run much deeper than mere differences in landscapes. From realm to realm life conditions vary enormously, including geography, history, fauna, flora and astronomical bodies. For each realm, the population is divided into very specific societies, although many attributes of each race remain common. Several royal families, powerful guilds, and wealthy, independent merchants all have their own specific goals and ambitions that are not at all connected to the grand schemes of the Patryn and the Sartan, which they mostly are unaware of at this time after centuries of their absence. The distinctiveness of each culture's circumstances and the individual diversity of the larger and smaller schemers within the cast of characters give a special magic and wonder to the proceedings in the game, especially when the player visits a new realm for the first time and starts exploring it. The worlds possess a mysterious, intriguing flavor, but with a touch of whimsical surprises from nearly everywhere. Each encounter with Xar between travels reveals more information concerning the whole mechanics that connect these realms.\n\nDeath Gate contains some exceptionally good voice acting. This is especially true for Henry Strozier who plays the role of Xar. He carries a low, charismatic, and authoritative voice that perfectly befits a character with a brave heart, long experience, deep wisdom, but a good share of arrogance. He shines for good measure too, since the player will spend more time conversing with his character than any other in the game. Haplo, who is only heard in conversations, voiced by David DeBoy, does not have a plain, uninteresting voice either. He sounds slightly arrogant and lordly like his master, but also rather youthful, yet manly enough to give an air of independency.\n\nThe MIDI music in Death Gate is very well done. The compositions are perfect for an epic fantasy setting. The tunes are often light and comforting, but they can change dramatically to a more majestic tone when visiting the king's palace and to a darker motif when exploring the undergrounds of Abarrach, the vicious Labyrinth, or the deadly Assassin's Guild.\n\nAside from Haplo and Xar, several other characters from the books also make an appearance in the game. Many of them, however, have been greatly simplified and reduced to only episodic roles with little development. Many major characters from the books are missing altogether, most notably Alfred, whose role is crucial in bringing out Haplo's characterization in the literary originals. On the other hand, some of the memorable archetypes from the books are used in new, interesting ways. For example, a boy named Bane has been recast into a different child with a different life and social standing, though both share a very similar personality. The character that stays most true to the canon is the whimsical, crazy wizard Zifnab, who appears in all his pun infested glory. In general, the plotlines are less violent and happier than those in the books, and the characters show less moral ambiguity.\n\nDeath Gate plays like a traditional point-and-click adventure game, but like a role-playing game it is as much about being free to explore the fictional world as about following a foreordained storyline thread. There is quite a bit of narrative text, diaries, historical documents, and dialogs to sieve through. They are all well written and are rather fascinating, since everything is directly connected to the quests the player needs to complete or the puzzles the player needs to solve. There is a fine dose of humor in the game too, but nothing so unsubtle that may distract from taking the main conflicts of the story seriously. From this stance, Death Gate is actually quite a departure from the largely comical gallery of previous game titles from Legend Entertainment.\n\nThe puzzles in Death Gate are a bit on the easy side, but the enjoyment they give is very well balanced by their ingenuity. The wealth of subplots, quests, plot twists, and deceptions add a lot of tension to the player's own proceedings. There is a certain logic and buttons based puzzle that is rather hard to beat. However, the player can ask for help from the game to solve it (or even skip over it). In general, the difficulty level of the game lies somewhere between easy and medium. The player can die in the game, but there is an option available to undo the player's last fatal action.\n\nComparison with the books quickly reveals some of the obvious budgetary or time constraints the developer must have faced during Death Gate's development. Pryan, the realm of fire, is build of elements taken not only of this realm in its original form but also of Chelestra, the realm of water. Consequently, the latter realm has shrunken to a very limited scope in the game. The smallness of Chelestra comes in the game as a particular disappointing revelation, since it is the last of the elemental realms that the player visits.\n\nThe interface used in Death Gate has evolved from the original Legend Entertainment's interactive fiction interface. There is an always available standard list of commands (such as Take, Look at, or Use) for the player to choose from, reminiscent of Lucasarts' SCUMM interface. In addition, extra action commands specific to an object appear when it is clicked. For example, when clicking on a door, apart from the standard list of verbs, there are added options to unlock, knock, or eavesdrop on the door. There are many actions which are not necessary to complete the game but which trigger funny responses specific to the situation. Altogether, the interface is a clever compromise between the sense of freedom achieved through a text parser and the simplicity of contemporary point-and-click style.\n\nGameplay in Death Gate draws on a few gimmicks that are typical of role-playing games. For some parts of the game, the player is able to have a party of several characters. There is also a process of collecting magical spells, even though they have been tweaked for solving puzzles instead of combat. A spell is constructed by connecting runes in a combination. After that, it is traced in the air by Haplo with his hands to bring the spell into motion. The player will be able to learn many spells in the game, mostly from the mensch. This is an important diversion from the canon, as the mensch from the books possess a different kind of magic altogether.\n\nThe high resolution graphics of the game will remind fans strongly of fantasy literature illustrated covers. The characters are beautifully detailed in high resolution, but rarely fully animated. However, their faces are always incredibly alive, especially in conversational close-ups. When exploring the game world, the player will notice many intricate but small animations in otherwise generally static sceneries. Major events occurring in the game are partially described in narrative text and partially presented as cut scenes. Sadly, the number of background illustrations in the game is a bit limited. All locations are shown from only a single point of view. Sometimes, the player is drawn to something interesting drawn at the edge of an illustration but is unable to look closely to find out more about it.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Legend Entertainment"],"publishers":["Legend Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":788832000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29tk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":2491,"name":"Descent to Undermountain","summary":"Descent to Undermountain is a first person RPG for the PC.

At first, it seems a very straightforward case: the body was discovered in the library, which had been locked from the inside, and the cause of death was an overdose of his prescribed antidepressants. But something just doesn't feel right. Could someone have killed Robner for his money? Did he make an enemy through his business dealings? Or was there some other motive? With the able assistance of level-headed Sgt. Duffy, the player has twelve hours to solve the case before it is closed forever.","genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Infocom","Infocom"],"publishers":["Commodore Electronics Ltd.","Infocom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit","Commodore C64/128/MAX","Atari ST/STE","Mac","DOS","Amiga","Apple II","TRS-80","Amstrad CPC","Amstrad PCW"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9ibk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":7699,"name":"Deathtrap","summary":"Deathtrap is a Tower Defense game with strong action-RPG elements, a game of vicious tricks, killing machines, rotating blades and splattering blood.

No hay ni héroes ni \nenemigos, simplemente un magnífico reto de tu habilidad. El objeto de \nDEFLEKTOR es de completar el circuito óptico. El láser produce un rayo de alta \nintensidad que debe llegar al receptor antes de que se haya reducido \ntotalmente la energía. Esto se consigue reflejando, refractando y polarizando \nel rayo por la pantalla; los obstáculos en el camino del rayo pueden reflejar, \nabsorber, o en el caso de la fibra óptica, transportar el rayo. Tienes el \npoder de controlar el rayo, pero la ruta hasta el receptor está cerrada hasta \nque hayas utilizado el láser para destruir todas las células. \n \nDebes tener cuidado de no sobrecargar el láser tocando minas o reflejando el \nrayo de nuevo sobre bu propio trazado. Pero no sólo eso: NO ESTAS SOLO... ten \ncuidado con los Gremlins! \n \nCONTROLANDO EL RAYO \n \nEl láser puede ser dirigido ajustando el ángulo de ios espejos. Los espejos \nque giran solos pueden parar, o girar más rápido, según la dirección en la que \nintentes moverlos. \n \nOtros factores no pueden ser controlados direc-tamente, pero se pueden usar \npara afectar al rayo de alguna manera, bien reflej�ndolo, bien \nrediri-giéndolo. En el caso de la fibra óptica, un rayo que da contra un \nbloque reaparecerá en otro bloque en otara parte de la pantalla. \n \nSituación de sobrecarga \n \nPuedes sobrecargar tu láser de tres maneras: \n \n1. Reflejo total. Si el rayo se refleja directamen-te sobre su propio \nrecorrido y vuelve al láser lo sobrecalentará. \n \n2. Demasiada distancia. Si el rayo debe reco-rer una distancia demasiado \nlarga se debilitará y hará fallar el laser. \n \n3. Alerta de minas. El rayo de láser ha colisio-nado con el campo de minas. \nSe crea un exceso de corriente que llevará rápidamente a un \nsobrecalentamiento. \n \nEn todos estos casos debes redirigir de inme-diato el rayo y esperar que \nvuelva a cero el indicador de sobrecarga.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Vortex Software"],"publishers":["Gremlin Graphics","Bullet-Proof Software"],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":567907200,"platforms":["Sharp X68000","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zc6gf9ne6ozmfca4hpii.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"75","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Deflektor"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"78","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-78/"}]},{"igdb_id":12044,"name":"Demoniak","summary":"Demoniak is an interactive fiction adventure in which the player guides four superheroes in an attempt to stop the evil Demoniak entering our dimension and doing dastardly things by sealing his gateway. \n \nThe player may 'become' another character at any time and give that character instructions, objects, such as weapons, may be passed from one character to another.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kgehi5aukvkzeq1i0hap.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1281832538","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Demoniak"}]},{"igdb_id":12045,"name":"Demon's Tomb: The Awakening","summary":"Demon's Tomb: The Awakening is a text adventure set on England on modern times.

Players are tasked with driving a train, adhering to the schedule and obeying signals and speed restrictions. It features real-world train lines from Japan, including the Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line. The game was ported to the PC, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation.\n\nThe concept for Densha de Go! was inspired by designer Akira Saito's personal fascination with Japanese train lines and railroads. He wanted to create a game that allowed players to familiarize themselves with driving a train. The controls were his primary focus as he wanted them to be accurate and responsive, and to mimic the controls of a real train—his father worked for the Kyoto City Transportation Bureau Facilities Division, which made this easier to accomplish. Saito included real-world railroads and trains to appeal towards other railroad enthusiasts, thinking that it could also attract more \"ordinary\" players for its realistic, familiar theme. As arcades at the time were dominated primarily by racing and fighting games, he believed its unique concept could make it stand out.\n\nDensha de Go! is among Taito's most successful games, preceded only by Space Invaders. The PlayStation version sold over one million copies. The game was well-received by critics for its controls, attention to detail, and unique concept. Some felt that its home releases lacked enough content and had poor visuals. It was followed by a long series of sequels, spin-offs, and reimaginings, beginning with Densha de Go! 2 in 1999.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Taito GM R&D Sect. #2"],"publishers":["Taito","UNBALANCE"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":857174400,"platforms":["Arcade","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25b3.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"36690","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-36690/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6944","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Densha de Go!"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"7590","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-7590/"}]},{"igdb_id":43896,"name":"Devilman","summary":"Devilman is a side scrolling platform action/adventure game based on Go Nagai's Devilman.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["ISCO"],"publishers":["Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":609465600,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2se1.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"33969","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Devilman"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"40724","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-40724/"}]},{"igdb_id":43915,"name":"Detective Barbie: The Mystery Cruise","summary":"Players have the chance to join \"Team Barbie Detective\" in Mattel Interactive's Detective Barbie: The Mystery Cruise.

Luckily, players will find many vehicles and gadgets in Detective Barbie: The Mystery Cruise to help them along the way.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Runecraft"],"publishers":["Mattel Media"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":974678400,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6t67.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1755969577","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Detective%20Barbie%3A%20The%20Mystery%20Cruise"}]},{"igdb_id":43940,"name":"Demolition Racer","summary":"Demolition Racer is a racing game with a twist. Rather than a game that just requires you to try and win the race, this game gives you points to destroy the other racers' cars. The game has many styles of game play so you don't have to play the same style each game.\n\nThere are 5 game styles in the Single Race section of the game. This section does not count towards unlocking cars or tracks. It is for practice and just plain fun. The main style is Demolition.\n\nIn Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall. You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car. When you finish the race, your final position is found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in. So if you finish first, but never hit anyone, you won't win the race.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Pitbull Syndicate"],"publishers":["Infogrames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":938736000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5etz.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"12458","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Demolition Racer"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"13576","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-13576/"}]},{"igdb_id":43975,"name":"Densetsu no Ogre Battle Gaiden: Zenobia no Ouji","summary":"Densetsu no Ogre Battle Gaiden: Zenobia no Ouji is a strategy video game developed by Quest for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, and is currently the only Ogre Battle title to not be released in English due to the system being discontinued in areas outside Japan.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":964224000,"platforms":["Neo Geo Pocket Color"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co398x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":43978,"name":"Delta Warp","summary":"Delta Warp is a Miscellaneous puzzle game, published by Iosys for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which was released in Japan in 2000.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":946684800,"platforms":["Neo Geo Pocket Color"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8j3g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":44012,"name":"Deer Drive Legends","summary":"\"Go for the ultimate trophy!

It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist \"swordsman\" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Humming Bird Soft"],"publishers":["Square"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":579484800,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7k9h.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":48515,"name":"De-Block","summary":"De-Block is a Puzzle game, published by Athena, which was released in Japan in 1991.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":684374400,"platforms":["Family Computer"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co740a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":48716,"name":"Deblock","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1047812432","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Deblock"}]},{"igdb_id":48902,"name":"Defender II","summary":null,"genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Vid Kidz"],"publishers":["HAL Laboratory"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":559440000,"platforms":["Family Computer","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8d5s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":48950,"name":"Dead Heat Scramble","summary":"Players must choose between a dune buggy, a sand rail vehicle, and the incredible off-road truck.

It is an original story, although the amusement park theme is constantly revisited in the franchise, especially in anime and game form. The protagonist is Conan Edogawa, the alter ego of Shinichi Kudō, a high school detective who was transformed unwillingly into a kid. Chika Yūenchi Satsujin Jiken itself is an adventure game where the task is to solve murder cases. The player controls Conan from a top-down perspective and can move around freely in the park, seeking for clues or engaging other characters in conversation. Sometimes it's possible to choose what to ask a character, but that has no outcome on how the case proceeds. The investigation is moved forward by talking to the right people, finding the necessary clues, solving puzzles and by \"thinking\". The latter is an actual gameplay mechanic where Conan analyses certain events that he finds suspicious. It ends with the player selecting one out of two deductions. If the incorrect answer was chosen, the accusation will not hold and the murderer will get away. Furthermore, it's possible to officially accuse a suspect with insufficient proof and without finishing the entire scenario, even if this results in arresting the wrong person or ending the game prematurely.\n\nThe game has three different murder cases, each corresponding to one of the attractions in the amusement park: the roller coaster, the horror house and the huge maze. The first attraction Conan enters after being greeted by Nobuhara and the staff decides which scenario the player will play. In order to switch to another murder case, the game must be started over. The only way to resume a previous session is via passwords the game gives at specific points during the scenario.\n\nA standard feature adopted by later installments is the presence of mini games. Two of them (a claw crane and a skateboarding game) can be played at any time in the Game Center, while others must be found or unlocked.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":851644800,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9h2k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"70132","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Detective%20Conan:%20Chika%20Yuuenchi%20Satsujin%20Jiken"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"39935","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-39935/"}]},{"igdb_id":64547,"name":"Detective Conan: Saikou no Aibou","summary":"Meitantei Conan: Saikou no Aibou is a PlayStation game released in 2002.

With historical trains, the route appears as it was during the 1950s.

There are many kinds of trains that you can drive, from express trains to monorails. Some trains are locked until you finish a mission, for example you can only drive monorails until you've finished the commuter and express train missions. All of the game parts, except the menu and station names, are in Japanese.\n\nIn addition or the Meitetsu Nagoya Line, coverage includes Meitetsu Inuyama Line, Meitetsu Minomachi Line and Meitetsu Monkey Park Monorail Line. This was the first version to feature a monorail, and also featured a Meitetsu hybrid light rail route which ran both on regular train lines and as a sort of urban tram on special lanes in city streets. Part of the gameplay of this required the user to stop for regular traffic signals and avoid car traffic. This was the Densha de Go player's first opportunity to drive a vehicle much lighter (and thus shorter stopping distance) than standard trains.\n\nIn this version, the driver must sound the horn before beginning to accelerate out of a station. This is unique to this title. The gameplay, physics, and strictness of this version were all somewhat relaxed compared to previous versions.\n\nThe game was published by Taito for the Sony PlayStation in Japan on January 27, 2000. It was later ported to the PC by Unbalance on December 1, 2000. The PS1 version later received a re-release as part of D3Publisher's Simple 1500 series of budget games, as Simple 1500 Series Vol. 102: The Densha Untenshi - Densha de Go!

Based on the novel Der Schatz im Silbersee by German author Karl May, this game let’s you join the wild west adventurers Old Firehand, chief Winnetou and Tante Droll on their way up the Arkansas River, through Utah to the Rocky Mountains. They’re searching for the famous treasure in Silver Lake, but they’re not the only ones: the unscrupulous Red Colonel and his band of tramps aren’t exactly eager to share... You take control of Old Firehand, performing actions with a set of only three basic commands and a good deal of inventory management. The game features four episodes: the steamer Dogfish, the rafter’s camp, Butler’s farm, and the treasure hunt at the Silbersee. The Eagle’s Tail and Utah chapters of the novel, roughly one half of the book, are omitted. The cast is greatly reduced, too, with neither Old Shatterhand nor any of the companions appearing at all. Knowledge of the book will not give you any advantages, as all of the puzzles are original and often deviate strongly from the events in the novel.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":["Linel"],"publishers":["Software 2000"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":750211200,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8y76.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":72101,"name":"Destination: Mars!","summary":null,"genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"7879","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-7879/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"7214","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Destination%3A%20Mars!"}]},{"igdb_id":72213,"name":"Despair 2","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"5577","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Despair 2"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6093","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-6093/"}]},{"igdb_id":72419,"name":"Death's Maze","summary":"Can you escape Deaths Maze and go to heaven?","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Kev Jackson"],"publishers":["Kev Jackson"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1507852800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2aqz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":72449,"name":"Dead Noir the Heart","summary":"Jackson Corpse, a hardened detective-turned-consultant who has seen the best and worst of life, finds himself following a string of murders across Ratliff City in hopes of catching the killer and bringing them down.

(loosely translated to \"Good Luck, Driver!!\") is an electric train driving simulation game developed and released by Taito for arcades in Japan on October 2000.\n\nA spin-off of the Densha de Go! series (and using the same engine as Densha de Go! 3 Tsuukin-hen), Ganbare Unten-shi!! focuses on light rail transit with two routes: the Enoshima Electric Railway and the Iyo Railway.\n\nWhile much of the game is the same as the main series, it modifies the braking and throttling controls for added precision and adds controls for operating the vehicle's doors. Due to street traffic, maintaining a timetable is not as strict as previous entries and the time-based penalty system is replaced with a \"lives\"-based one.\n\nThe game was later ported to both the PlayStation 2 (on July 25, 2002) and PC (by Unbalance on June 5, 2003) as Densha de Go! Ryojou-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Emotional Travel Edition\"). This version features features an updated graphics engine (based on Densha de Go! Shinkansen) and adds four additional routes: two from the Keifuku Electric Railroad and two from the Hakodate Transportation Bureau.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Taito GM R&D Sect. #2"],"publishers":["Taito","Unbalance Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":970358400,"platforms":["Arcade","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yzw.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"130962","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Densha%20de%20Go!%20Ryojouhen"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"41883","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-41883/"}]},{"igdb_id":79458,"name":"Desolator","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79539,"name":"Desert Storm Command Deluxe","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79555,"name":"Detective Conan: Kieta Hakase to Machigai Sagashi no Tou","summary":"The second Detective Conan game published by Bandai for the Nintendo DS","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z8m3upd7ltqvm2tlw2ey.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79556,"name":"Detective Conan: Aoki Houseki no Rinbukyoku - Rondo","summary":"The fourth Detective Conan game published by Bandai for the Nintendo DS.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a3yybcrpquhwm5h80nkp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79641,"name":"Dengeki Bunko ADV: Baccano!","summary":"Based on the two Grand Punk Railroad light novels, the game recounts the events aboard the Flying Pussyfoot train from multiple perspectives.The player's goal is to help the passengers arrive safely in New York City by selecting the correct choices.

Weapons can be upgraded by collecting items left by defeated enemies, similar to the Turrican games, but the protagonist may only have one long-range weapon; picking up another replaces the old one.

In the span of two generations the town was built up to the status of prestige it now commands, an expansion helmed by the Hadou Group, an industrial complex and family dynasty currently run by the young Hadou Ruri. She pursues the peace and prosperity of Arkham diligently, against the forces of darkness threatening to plunge the city, and the world, back into a second dark age. Among the most sinister threats to Arkham City is the evil Black Lodge syndicate. Led by the charismatic Master Therion, his nihilistic outlook shapes the group's destructive goals: with a circle of powerful sorcerers at his command, the potential for sowing chaos in the city is unmatched.\n\nFormer Miskatonic University Magic Academy student Daijuuji Kurou knows little of grimoires, but what he does know terrifies him - enough that he left his university life behind, and now practices a failing detective business in the shelter of an orphanage in a quiet corner of Arkham. But just when he thought his Academy past was buried, it catches up with him and pulls him back into the dark shadows of the occult: Hadou Ruri herself appears at his door with an offer he can't refuse. The only way to combat the Black Lodge's growing magical power is to find, and retrieve, a grimoire with the power to activate the mightiest Machina of all: Demonbane. The quest to find this forbidden tome will change Kurou's destiny... forever.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":["Nitro Plus"],"publishers":["Nitro Plus","JAST USA"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1051228800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fch.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":97101,"name":"Deliverace","summary":"Pick a car, invite your friends and enter the fray.

Players are tasked with guiding a train to its destination under a time limit while managing its acceleration and speed limitations. It features real-world train stations and train lines from Japan, including the Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line. The game was ported to several home consoles, including the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation.\n\nThe concept for Densha de Go! was inspired by designer Akira Saito's personal fascination with Japanese train lines and railroads. He wanted to create a game that allowed players to familiarize themselves with driving a train. The controls were his primary focus as he wanted them to be accurate and responsive, and to mimic the controls of a real train—his father worked for the Kyoto City Transportation Bureau Facilities Division, which made this easier to accomplish. Saito included real-world railroads and trains to appeal towards other railroad enthusiasts, thinking that it could also attract more \"ordinary\" players for its realistic, familiar theme. As arcades at the time were dominated primarily by racing and fighting games, he believed its unique concept could make it stand out.\n\nPorts for the Game Boy Color and WonderSwan were published in 2000.","genres":["Simulator","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito GM R&D Sect. #2"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":920505600,"platforms":["Game Boy Color","WonderSwan"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2s7a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":143427,"name":"Decisive Campaigns: Ardennes Offensive","summary":"Decisive Campaigns: Ardennes Offensive is the fourth wargame in the Decisive Campaign series.

Though it is listed as one of Doomworld's Top 100 WADs of All Time in the year 1999, its release on the idgames archive dates it at 17 March of 2000. It is known primarily for being composed of short, fairly straightforward levels, a possible progenitor of Erik Alm's Scythe.\n\nDemonfear is a compilation of small episodes released by Windsor between 1995 and 1999, known otherwise as Demonfear 1-6. An early, alternate version of Demonfear 6 was partially complete in 1997, but Windsor donated the maps to Requiem when the project had stagnated due to a handful of authors failing to provide maps for slots they had claimed. The compiler dropped Windsor's levels into the previously vacant slots so that his old Demonfear 6 MAP26, 27, and 28 appear as Requiem's MAP20, 26, and 25, respectively. Windsor would go on to create a new Demonfear 6 and then compile his own megawad.\n\nDemonfear comes with a text file that describes in detail the story of the megawad on a level-by-level basis. The plot involves another surprise demon invasion of Earth; mirroring the action of Doom II, the protagonist travels through various military complexes and into a city, eventually entering Hell itself in what is apparently a twisted facsimile of the normal world.\n\nIn 2019, Doomworld user P41R47 made a MIDI pack for Demonfear, which also includes miscellaneous enhancements for the intermission, text screens, and ending.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Adam Winsor"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":953251200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4n49.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":144427,"name":"Deutschlands Brettspiele","summary":null,"genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":["rondomedia GmbH"],"publishers":["cerasus.media"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2uq7.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"1737443617","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Deutschlands%20Brettspiele"}]},{"igdb_id":144428,"name":"Deutschlands Kartenspiele","summary":null,"genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":["rondomedia GmbH"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2uq8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"982494441","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Deutschlands%20Kartenspiele"}]},{"igdb_id":144450,"name":"Deepest Chamber: Resurrection","summary":"Rally your party.

Their mission was to find the mysterious crystal that existed inside each planet. When the Crystal was found, it would wake up the ancient powers of magic, which would extend to every place in the universe, giving rise the origin of the worlds.\nThis is the story of Arco, the youngest of the princes who inhabited the smallest of the minor planets: Deiland, the Tiny.\"\nDeiland is a completely offline game, where we control the prince Arco to develop his daily life on a very small planet.\nCREATE A HOME We start from scratch, on an empty little planet but full of surprises. The first step is to create the tools, which you work with: a hoe to till the fields, an axe for get firewood, a hammer to build, etc. Soon we discover the pleasures of life in Deiland: collect fruits, get the first harvest or watch a meteor fall.\n\nMAKE OBJECTS Little by little we will be bringing a lot of objects and materials that can be combined into the workshop to get new tools, materials derivatives (such as fabric, glass bottles or forged metal), dishes or even magic potions. Our home will be transformed from a tent to a big house, capable of forging, kitchen and laboratory. How many objects will we be able to create?\nTRADE WITH YOUR PRODUCTS As we develop the planet, it will be more attractive for merchants, who will come to us for materials to buy or sell. Meet Brram, the chef who creates dishes of high stellar cuisine; Mun, a brave hunter of bugs and the sorcerer Lock, a very nice old man obsessed with potions and spells.\nDISCOVER THE MAGIC AND DEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES But all is not peaceful in Deiland. Often, enemies appear to steal your booty. You'll fight limos, giant spiders, bats, poisonous flowers, and even giant trolls. Learn magic spells to defeat them and, with the power of Cristal, keep safe the planet Deiland.\nENJOY NATURE Life on the planet Deiland is wonderful. You will be in direct contact with nature: - Develop beautiful forests of oaks, pines and wild shrubs. - Enjoy the rainwater, which is a treasure that must be used well. - Contemplate the passage of time, with morning, sunsets and nights in the space. - Get good time to go fishing in the lake. You can catch large fish for your dishes and recipes.\nDeiland is a great adventure game in which we should take decisions and develop the magic ecosystem of a tiny planet.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Chibig"],"publishers":["Chibig"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1455235200,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9zic.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":174645,"name":"Devil Piece","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"725253386","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Devil%20Piece"}]},{"igdb_id":174695,"name":"Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat","summary":"Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is a mobile action RPG spin-off of the Devil May Cry series.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["NebulaJoy"],"publishers":["NebulaJoy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1623369600,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7kkm.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"20242251","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Devil%20May%20Cry:%20Peak%20of%20Combat"}]},{"igdb_id":174784,"name":"Deep Insanity Asylum","summary":"Set in the near future where humans have to struggle against a sleeping sickness called the Randolph Syndrome.

It's a mod for UT2004, but it has nothing to do with a shooter (a pure sports game).\n\nSo you got these football pitches, and you have to get the ball into the enemy goal. You have a hammer tool. With that one you can kick other players around, kill the enemy ballowner with 2 hits and also kick the ball away (volley).\nIn your own penalty zone you can kill all enemy players with one hit. With the ball launcher you can charge up a shot, the longer you hold it the harder it will be and you can even add spin to the ball, so it will curl in the air.\nJust like in football you should have a keeper in your goal. He has some special abilities like he's 30% faster than others,he can dodge and jump higher.\nDeath Ball should be played with 6-10 players\nThe gameplay is very easy too learn, but it's hard to master. At first it seems to be pretty simple, but the more you play the more you realise how complex it is and how many possibilities your team has. The ways to score are infinite.","genres":["Fighting","Shooter","Sport"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1145836800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":182485,"name":"Dead or Alive 3++","summary":"Dead or Alive 3++ was released as a rebalanced version of Dead or Alive 3 for the original Xbox game system. It features various system and character balances from the previous three versions of Dead or Alive 3. Some minor tweaks have been added to the game system in the form of a four-way hold system, unrestricted 3D-axis movement, and less emphasis on the critical stun system. Some attack commands for characters are updated. The tag team system, introduced in the previous game, was also updated. Tag Battle was made available during the game's Time Attack and Survival modes. A new feature called Attack Change was added, allowing the character tagging in to attack while switching in. The Tag Throws command was made a bit easier to activate. By default, the game utilizes the Xbox controller's analog face buttons, making the controls lenient to allow players new to the series to adapt to gameplay, players have the option to turn the analog buttons on or off. As with previous entries in the series, it took advantage of the Xbox system's power to push the range of the graphics and stage sizes farther than Dead or Alive 2.","genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1015113600,"platforms":["Xbox"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co49mn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":182559,"name":"Deathroned","summary":"Deathroned is a hectic first-person shooter in which the player takes on the role of a powerful sorceress making her way within an enchanted palace inspired by One Thousand and One Nights.

The game is set on either an unnamed planet or city (depending on platform) where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis's first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Defender was demonstrated in late 1980 and was released in March 1981. It was distributed in Japan by Taito.\n\nDefender was one of the most important titles of the golden age of arcade video games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best-selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry and one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of horizontal scrolling shoot 'em ups. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.\n\nPorts were developed for contemporary game systems, most of them by either Atari, Inc. or its software label for non-Atari platforms, Atarisoft. The 1982 Atari 2600 version was one of the best-selling games for the system and sold over 3 million cartridges.\n\nsource: Wikipedia","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Williams Electronics"],"publishers":["Atari","Sears","Polyvox"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":410140800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7ezw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":278195,"name":"Defend the Base: Tower Turret Shooting Range","summary":"The turret is ready, shooter!

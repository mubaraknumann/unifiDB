Lend an ear...\n\nYou will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:\n\nTHE SEAGULL:\nPeriodically, a seagull will fly overhead. You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color. Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid. This is the best way to gain points. Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.\n\nTHE SLIP:\nAnother great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him \"the slip\". If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave. Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately. As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.\n\nSCORING:\nPoints are earned in a variety of ways. Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points. The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.\n\nAlso, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave. And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Activision"],"publishers":["Activision"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":441676800,"platforms":["Atari 2600"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co988x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":213989,"name":"DodgeKing","summary":"Grab your knight and enter the robot-infested gauntlet to be the next DodgeKing!

The player can choose from five characters known as Pokepi and interact with them in an apartment.

It allowed the player to take any of the Pokepi with them anywhere, and they can continue to interact through the device. A remaster of the game was released on the PlayStation Portable on December 7, 2004 for the franchise's 5th anniversary.

For some reason, the development stopped, so we have only a single background, a single BG music (though it's quite a good one), no endings (not even some credits rolling), practically not configurable keyboard controls (you can only change functions between the predefined keys) and no difficulty levels - the only way to get an easier challenge is reducing the other player's energy in the options screen. There should even be a secret character named Sayuri, but... There are no files related to her...\n\nThe rest, however, makes up greatly for these lacks. The nine characters are well-done in every aspect: good characterization (and don't forget their portraits in the selection and VS screen: beautiful), great and fluid animations, many special moves with a lot of spectacular graphic effects. Each one is available in eight different color palettes, and there's even a secret menu in the options to edit them! The most powerful moves require the pressure of two attack keys together, and for this reason there are four shortcut keys too. I had many problems with the standard layout, which forces the player to use the left hand to move, until I found out that the \"Dolphin-Mode\" option enables another keyboard layout (see the reference card). There are no more shortcut keys for easier super moves this way, but it isn't a big deal since the keystrokes detection is always flawless - in fact, I hardly ever used the shortcuts even in normal mode :) Fast, fun gameplay and combative AI ensure a good challenge for a game that, if brought to 100% completion, would rival many commercial productions in quality.

A special board is dedicated to show the relationships of all suspects to the victim or to each other. Here the player also orders the surveillance of a suspect. The computer has a timeline of the crime saved which is used to find discrepancies in the statements of the suspects and unaccounted time. Finally the map shows all locations which are relevant to the investigation.\n\nBefore the interrogations the player has to choose up to three topics.

It is based on Doom3D, though rewritten for OpenGL rather than DirectX, and including some bug fixes from Boom and MBF. It aims to recreate the look and feel of Doom 64 as closely as possible, based on specifications obtained through reverse engineering, similarly to how Kaiser also created SvStrife.\n\nThe first public version of Doom64 EX was released on July 10, 2008.\n\nCompared to the Doom 64: Absolution TC, the principal difference is that Doom64 EX uses the original data. A tool provided with the port can create a DOOM64.WAD IWAD from the ROM.\n\nDoom 64 plays almost identically to earlier games in the Doom series; the player must advance through numerous levels fighting demons, collecting weapons and keys and hitting switches in order to reach the level's exit while surviving deadly traps and ambushes. Changes were made to the Doom engine for use in Doom 64, and gameplay elements were altered.\n\nWeapons\nAll the weapons from the original game are present, but redrawn with new sprites. The chainsaw was given two blades instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves on instead of brass knuckles, the plasma rifle has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back a bit, the shotgun's reloading cock is at the handle instead of under the barrel and the Super Shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil.\n\nA new weapon known as the Laser, or \"Unmaker\", was added, using the same cell ammunition as the plasma rifle and BFG. It was first mentioned in the Doom Bible and was planned to be featured in the PC Doom games but never appeared. Its appearance in Doom 64 is its only official appearance. With the power of three ancient artifacts found in the game, it becomes more powerful by shooting three laser beams (at a quicker rate than default) instead of one. The first artifact increases the laser speed, the second artifact adds a second laser and the third artifact allows the weapon to fire three simultaneous lasers which can automatically aim separately from one another, allowing the weapon to attack three different enemies at once.\n\nPlot\nFollowing the conclusion of the original Doom series, the sole Marine who survived the horrors of hell had returned to Earth, reclaiming it from the invasion that almost eradicated the human race. Demons still lingered within the abandoned halls and complexes of Phobos and Deimos. As a last-ditch effort, the military decided to bombard the moons with extreme radiation in hopes of killing off any remaining demons. Initially it was successful, however something survived the exposure. The radiation blocked the military's sensors and allowed something to slip past them undetected. This mysterious entity, possessing the ability to resurrect any demon it came across, recreated the entire demonic horde and made it stronger than ever before. A Marine strike force was ordered to contain the advancing armies of hell but was mercilessly slaughtered within moments. The player's character is the sole survivor of this group.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Samuel Villarreal"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1218326400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jmi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":250508,"name":"Doctor Who: The Doctor and the Dalek","summary":"It's time to save the universe!

Compendium is as the name implies a compilation-style project, containing a hand picked collection of some of the best doom maps/wads released from 1994 to roughly 2004-2005, representing the classic era of Doom modding. All the mappacks represented have been remastered (in the sense that outdated DeHackED code has been converted to DECORATE/ACS) and bugfixed (generally speaking I've removed all bugs I've found which can allow a player to become stuck in a level, including a ton of fixes that should ensure much better multiplayer compatibility), but they are otherwise untouched, as it is not my intention to mess with the authors' original vision. This means that there are no new rooms, no different thing placements and nothing of the sort to be found in this. Each of the wads included in this is accessible from a (currently functional but unfinished) central hub map. After you complete one of the mappacks, you are sent back to the hub map, which means you can keep your arsenal when going to the next one (or simply start a new game to be taken back to the same hub map with a clear arsenal).\n\nThere are right now 54 wads represented, for a total of over one thousand levels. I've tried to ensure that this project is fully compatible with gameplay mods, and hopefully that is indeed the case: this includes the wads that previously broke horribly due to dehacked patches. Please note however that as of the current release there are no new weapons included. Some of the wads included in this are well known vanilla megawads from the time, such as Memento Mori, Obituary and STRAIN. Others are wads that take advantage of ZDoom features, such as Daedalus and Project Slipgate. Others yet take Doom gameplay to creative new heights, like Cyberdreams or All Hell is Breaking Loose. Some are celebrated classics, others are undiscovered gems. Some, like Eternal Doom, have absolutely massive maps which will take a long time to navigate, others, like Scythe, focus on quick and intense gun and run action. I've tried to go for as much variety as I could in terms of the styles of gameplay and level design offered here, so I am sure that you are bound to find at least one mappack you'd really like in this.\n\nSome might wonder what the point of such a project is. One could, after all, simply download the relevant wads off the idgames database as needed. And indeed, my aim here is not that of replacing the original files, which should be preserved and rejoiced in exactly the way they used to be. As far as I'm aware there have not been similar projects to this released yet, although other communities such as the Duke Nukem 3D one have made something comparable. That being said, the advantages of having a project like this are numerous. For one thing all the 54 wads included here are completely cross-compatible which means you don't have to load each of them separately. This is particularly advantageous for those who wish to play using RPG-style mods with a very large arsenal and experience systems, etc (DoomRL comes to mind for example). It is also extremely useful for multiplayer hosting on Zandronum, as instead of hosting 54 servers you would need to host only one. Now not only that but as I mentioned, the code conversion and bugfixing makes these the most up to date and polished repackagings that these wads have seen yet. Some of these were still stuck in old DOS installers and such, personally I think it's about time someone made a modern repackaging to be enjoyed by all GZDoom users without hassle. Last but not least, I have spent a very long time digging the idgames archives (among other sites) to find interesting old wads that have slipped past the spotlights, so this project beyond being one of bugfixing and ease of use, is also (at least as far as I'm concerned) one of documentation. This is a love letter to that period of Doom modding which in my opinion holds some of the best maps ever made for the game, from which I think mappers even today could have a lot to learn.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1499385600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4sje.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":232578,"name":"Doodle Smash!","summary":"Faster!

To do so means digging downwards, making sure it does not smash in the process. As a puzzle-platformer, everything is affected by gravity, and if the egg falls from a great height, it will smash. Success is achieved by making your way down the playfield carefully.\n\nYou control a penguin. 1 jumps, 2 digs. The penguin can push the egg left or right, and can jump on it to make sure it doesn't get stuck against a wall. Digging affects the tile one block left (or right) and one block down away from the penguin's position, meaning it is impossible to dig straight downwards. If the egg gets into a position where it cannot be moved left or right, jumping and landing on it will cause it to smash.\n\nThe penguin cannot be damaged, but can be temporarily stunned, the objective being to protect the egg, not necessarily yourself.

The elbow attack and turning jump kick are gone, but with the standard kick directed backwards they seemed a bit redundant anyway. There are two new ways to make enemies in a grapple suffer, elbow smashes to the head, and a high kick to propel them away. In the brief time window when the Lee brothers are crouching after a jump or after getting knocked down, it’s possible to perform a rising uppercut or a knee jump attack. The timing for these isn’t easy, but they are the most powerful moves in the game.\n\nOn the NES, Double Dragon II is a much more innovative and unique sequel than in the arcade, but it marks also the time Double Dragon started its schizophrenic shifting between wildly different tones and gameplay styles. In a way it’s one of the best games to bear the Double Dragon name, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that Technōs had already started to loose a cohesive vision of what it meant to be Double Dragon, both in tone and in gameplay.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Technos Japan"],"publishers":["Technos Japan","Arc System Works"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":630288000,"platforms":["Nintendo 3DS","Wii","Family Computer","Wii U","Nintendo Entertainment System"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4wy0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":159575,"name":"Doomed Lands","summary":"Doomed Lands is a survival game where the protagonist must collect, build, mine, face enemies, bosses and survive a doomed land.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Nibb Games"],"publishers":["Freedom Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1681689600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4613.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":158231,"name":"Dooria","summary":"An intricate hardcore puzzle game within a world that feels both familiar and foreign, allowing you to lust for the solution or meander without aim for a journey entirely your own.","genres":["Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1594944000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4615.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":162831,"name":"Donkey Kong Country Mania","summary":"Donkey Kong Country Mania is a ROM hack/mod of Donkey Kong Country that aims to mix some old and new together much like the game that inspired this hack, Sonic Mania.

The BFG Edition also features the ability to use the flashlight while holding a weapon, in the form of the so-called armor-mounted flashlight.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["id Software"],"publishers":["Bethesda Softworks"],"aggregated_rating":71.33333333333333,"release_date":1350259200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ovt.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"xbox36066acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802425307f1","url":"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/DOOM-3-BFG-Edition/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802425307f1"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"com.id.doom3bfg","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.id.doom3bfg"}]},{"igdb_id":61341,"name":"Donkey Xote","summary":"Enjoy this original adventure game hand in hand with its main characters.

Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side.\n\nThe game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions) and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective.\n\nThe characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).\n\nThere are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his death means total defeat.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Tactical"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Beyond"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":470707200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8ikn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":237232,"name":"Dotgeon","summary":"Dotgeon is 2D action-adventure arcade game.

Each day runs rather quickly and the player can play only a few activities. Training your fighters is essential, as is winning in the arena and obtaining prizes and resources that will allow us to better equip our gladiators and obtain favors from the authorities.\n\nThe fights are always risky because no result is perfectly guaranteed and losing the best fighters is a tragedy from which you recover only with great difficulty, especially when you are defeated in fights between teams of gladiators. Over time their ludus will grow in celebrity (in case of success) and we can compete with increasingly complex challenges, including participation in tournaments in various parts of Italy of increasing difficulty against opponents.\n\nFinally, there are the touches of class as gladiators who get drunk in the arena (if you insist on rewarding them with wine during training), weapons launched by the public to help a fighter, severed limbs and the ability to post on facebook and twitter replays duels.\n\nBut Domina also impresses with a different aspect from that of mere gameplay or production values. Domina is in fact a title designed to be played in a stream and offers several moments of meaningful interaction with the spectators. First of all, once the Twitch mode is activated, the game collects the names of the stream viewers and uses them for the various gladiators that the streamer manages during the game; both the first batch of fighters and all subsequent new arrivals will be identifiable as the stream viewers.\n\nAlready this, by itself, allows Domina to acquire a new level of interaction with the public and, therefore, of entertainment. The viewers follow the story of their character, require training, new equipment and invoke the use in the arena. As has already happened in an unstructured way in games like X-Com (the streamer created the characters in the image and request of the viewers), so it happens in a structured and automatic way in Domina.\n\nBut that is not all. In Domina the viewers vote in the various multi-choice events proposed by the game using a mechanism similar to other 'stream based' games. And then you enter the arena and the fun is multiplied because not only spectators can participate by launching incitements and insults (thus determining other game statistics), but, in case a gladiator surrenders without being killed, they can vote for death or life through the classic thumb up / down.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":["DolphinBarn"],"publishers":["DolphinBarn"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1491177600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w4a.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":59750,"name":"Double Yakuman Jr.","summary":"The second game in the Double Yakuman series.","genres":["Card & Board Game"],"developers":[],"publishers":["VAP"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Game Boy"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9h2y.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245993,"name":"Dominus Solaris","summary":"In the year 2073, the Skolovan Empire attacked and subdued planet Earth.

The player can perform a series of punches or a kick on most enemies, followed by straight punch or a high kick that knocks the enemy to the floor. Pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously will cause the player to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform an aerial uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly punch his opponent in the face or push them to the ground. While standing near a fallen enemy, a jumping knee drop can be performed. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other games in the series.\n\nThe game is composed of three missions, spread across ten stages. The first two missions each consist of four stages that follows a basic structure: the player fight their way through a street until reaching the boss. This is followed by a subway platform, a fight inside a subway car, and the destination platform, where the player confronts another boss. The final mission, composed of only two stages, starts at the streets again, but this time the player must fight his way to the entrance of the Scorpions headquarters. Once inside the building, the player fight their way through a series of floors, including an area where all the previous bosses appear, until reaching the top floor where Anderson awaits.

A level 20 naked character will more or less fight at the same level of a naked level 1 character.\n\nCrafting gear happens at crafting stations where the player can combine over 20 different materials with gear blueprints to get a combination of bonuses unique to that particular combination. A stone helm will need strength to handle, but will provide more protection than one made of magic crystals, wich in turn will be way more useful to increase the mana pool of the character.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Heartbit Interactive"],"publishers":["Heartbit Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1600387200,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ht3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":143158,"name":"Don't Get Bit","summary":"It's the zombie apocalypse and Cassie, a sarcastic 18 year old armed with only her wits and a kitchen knife, must get to her uncle’s farm.

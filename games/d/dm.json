This title is a reimagining of the series, with the same protagonist Dante, but set in an alternate universe. The Dante in this game is very different from before, doing away with the trademark white hair and altering the main character as well as the game's tone with a much more Western influence. The gameplay is still largely identical as Dante engages many opponents with a fast fighting style, stringing together combos and hits in quick succession.","genres":["Puzzle","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Ninja Theory"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":81.5,"release_date":1358208000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1u77.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":20869,"name":"DmC: Devil May Cry - Definitive Edition","summary":"DmC: Devil May Cry - Definitive Edition includes all the stylish action gameplay from the original release, all previously released downloadable content, including the Vergil's Downfall campaign plus brand new modes and additional content, making this the ultimate offering for Devil May Cry fans.

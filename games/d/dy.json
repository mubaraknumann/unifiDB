By completing story missions, some characters are added and can be played as without starting a new game, meaning all acquired weapons, items and materials will be kept.\n\nThe chosen character can be customized in various ways. Apart from the main weapon, one sub weapon, chosen from many weapon types, can be equipped. Both weapons can be switched anytime during battle, to accommodate the situation. A new addition is the Chi system which allows to set special abilities to the character, there are four slots to equip Chi (the two arms and legs). Weapons can also be customized by adding Orbs that give different abilities, such as elemental properties.\n\nIn the village, the player can exchange materials, buy weaponry, items for use in battle, Chi skills and Orbs. Some NPC's may appear in the village, some giving materials or items, or Officer cards, which can be set to help the Village's growth. Over time, better items can be acquired from the shops.\n\nBy talking to the quest board or the Guard at the village's gate, main Missions or Requests can be chosen. Each battle is a series of small maps where various enemy soldiers and weaponry are fought, eventually leading to the commander of the enemy army. The goal of each battle can vary, some are classic goals like \"Defeat the Commander\" and some, less battle oriented, like \"Retrieve all treasure boxes\". In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion.\n\nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage.\n\nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them.

Alien opposition can be destroyed by shooting them, but after six hits the helicopter gets destroyed. \n \nThe basic goal is to destroy a number of robots which are found by using the radar. However, the chopper is not able to destroy those; that's why it carries the Battledroid, a tank. When the chopper lands, the tank is detached and can be driven over the surface of the island. A side effect of destroying the robots is the rescue of human scientists which are held hostage in said robots. They can be picked up with the helicopter and brought to the base. While this is not required to finish the level, rescued scientists net vital upgrades like better weapons, a better shield or the ability to move underwater. All those upgrades can be either applied to the chopper or the tank. \n \nAfter all robots are destroyed, a volcano opens up and the player moves right in. In the following section the game transforms into a vertically scrolling shooter. Gameplay in these sections is traditional, save for the fact that the player travels downwards from the upper part of the screen: dodging enemy bullets and shooting as many aliens as possible until the level end boss is reached and defeated.

These Obstacle attacks can disrupt an opponent's progress and are crucial to victory, especially in the game's wireless Vs. mode.","genres":["Strategy","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Omega Force"],"publishers":["Koei"],"aggregated_rating":50.0,"release_date":1175731200,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co67vq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":21712,"name":"Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition","summary":"\"Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends\" introduces entirely new levels of fun to the refreshing gameplay vanquishing swarms of enemies with mighty warriors found in \"Dynasty Warriors 8.\" In story mode, where you can immerse yourself in the vivid tales of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it is now possible to play as the mighty warrior \"Lu Bu,\" and embark on a journey that depicts his way of life.

Four \"armies\" in two different colors are at the center. \n \nA flashing question mark at the right hand side of the screen is asking if the \"armies\" of that color are to be played by a person or the computer. \n \nPress \"yes\" on the alpha-numeric keyboard for person. Press \"no\" for computer. \n \nIf you have entered \"yes,\" a second symbol will appear followed by a flashing question mark. If you wish that color played by a person, press \"yes.\" If you want to play against the computer, press \"no.\" \n \nIf you have elected to play against the computer, the symbol for microprocessor will appear on the screen. \n \nIf you are playing against another person, individual timers will appear separately at the top of the screen. Player one's timer will appear first. \n \nYou can enter up to 99 minutes of time for each player in the game. Different times may be entered for each player to give a novice more of a chance against an experienced player. If you want to play with no time limit, enter 00 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nIf you are playing against the computer, the microprocessor will make its move instantly. It can make more than 100,000 electronic decisions per second. \n \nThe object of the game is to occupy as much of the matrix as possible. \n \nThe game begins with two \"armies\" of each color at the center of the matrix. \n \nThe game ends when the board is filled or when neither player can enter a move and capture and opposing \"army.\" The player with the most \"armies\" on the matrix is the winner. A running score appears at the top of the screen throughout the game. \n \nEvery entry must satisfy two conditions: \n- An \"army\" must always be placed next to an opponents \"army.\" \n- One or more of the opposing \"armies\" must be trapped by the newly entered \"army\" and another \"army\" of the same color. The trapped \"armies\" will automatically change to the conqueror's color. \n \nIf these condition cannot be met, there will be an audio signal and the player loses a turn. \n \nUse the joy stick of the hand control to position the box on the screen where you want to locate an \"army.\" Press the action button to enter the \"army\" onto the screen. Player one uses the left hand control. Player two uses the right hand control. \n \nPlayers may capture more than one army in different directions on the same move. The directions may be in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal straight line. \n \nSecret strategy hints. \n- The corners are the most important strategic positions. Once an \"army\" occupies a corner, it controls three directions. An \"army\" commanding a corner position cannot be captured because it cannot be surrounded on two sides in a straight line. \n- The outside positions of the matrix are very important because they effect five directions but are only vulnerable from two sides. \n- Caution! Be careful before occupying the first rows inside the perimeter of the matrix. They are jumping off points to the outside and corner positions. \n \n \nVERSION II: DIRECTIONAL DYNASTY \n \nPress 1 on the alpha-numeric keyboard if you are playing on color TV. \n \nPress 3 on the alpha-numeric keyboard if you are playing on Black and White TV. \n \nEnter player information and timer settings as per Dynasty rules 4 through 9. \n \nDirectional Dynasty differs from Dynasty in only one way, but it changes the game completely.

The floors are constantly shifting at random and nobody's seen the exit, so good luck with that.  \n \nHowever, that same space-time nonsense seems to affect you as well. You find yourself with strange abilities you've never had before.  \n \nYou and your three companions will use your new ESP abilities to attempt to break out of this place. Navigate the shifting floors, destroy your enemies, even reincarnate and mutate into the ultimate fighting machine!  \n \nIt's all useless, of course... or is it?","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":["L.O.V.E.

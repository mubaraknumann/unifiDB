The game features overall 98 courses, but some of those are just variations of the same. Also on board is the iconic ability to turn back time after screwing up.\n\nIn contrast to Dirt 2, in this installment there are other playing modes than the career available, e.g. a single race. But the career is still the heart of the game; here the player tunes his car, participates in races and earns experience points, which are used to unlock new cars. There are six different race modes to solve during the career; e.g. regular races and \"trailblazer\" (no passenger available). Two of those are newly introduced: drift tournaments and Gymkhana, which are basically confined areas with a lot of stunt opportunities - the goal is to perform as many as possible in a limited time. Additionally every mode has special tricky bonus goals which reward more experience when fulfilled.","genres":["Racing","Sport"],"developers":["Codemasters Southam"],"publishers":["Codemasters"],"aggregated_rating":85.85714285714286,"release_date":1306195200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gdo.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"27382","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/DiRT%203"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"44320","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/44320/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802434d083d","url":"https://marketplace.xbox.com//en-US/Product/DiRT-3/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802434d083d"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"UCc-AJvuhz6vcdcY0XK_QvMA","url":"https://gaming.youtube.com/game/UCc-AJvuhz6vcdcY0XK_QvMA"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"30383","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-30383/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"xbox36066acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802434d083d","url":"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/DiRT-3/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802434d083d"}]},{"igdb_id":533,"name":"Dishonored","summary":"Dishonored is an immersive first-person action game that casts you as a supernatural assassin driven by revenge.

Royal Navy Fleet weapons are only slightly inferior to the reworked weapons of the Procyon Fleet but are sturdier and less vulnerable. Ships for the Royal Navy range from torpedo boats and war sloops to escorts, frigates, and the impressive StarHammer, while pirates man sloops, gunboats, schooners, assault cutters, and more, including several unique designs like the carrack and barque. The Procyon Fleet is built for speed and maneuverability, geared for fast hit-and-run attacks, and as the game progresses, news of a mysterious Ironclad Fleet surfaces as well.\n\nShip designs in Battle at Procyon are fashioned after the seafaring ships from the golden age of sail, with solar winds filling the sails and rigging. Arsenals reflect futuristic models of light, medium, and heavy weapons such as laserball and plasma cannons, beam weapons, Gatling guns, harpoons, fire and net launchers, gravity waves, torpedoes, mortars, and more.

Most weapons are automatically lost at the end of each action scene, but hand guns can be retained so long as they have ammunition remaining. The typical level structure is a number of minions the player must defeat in many rooms, followed by a boss. Bosses can be anything from human minions of White Fang to spider robots. Quick Time Events are interspersed between many of the scenes. In these events, the player(s) may be running and turning a corner and they face an enemy, so they must perform a designated command to avoid being injured or to help defeat an enemy. In some cases failing a Quick Time Event will result in loss of health, as is usual for QTEs, but failing most will put the player characters into an additional action scene which they otherwise would not have to complete.

If your answer to these questions is yes, then I’m happy to introduce Diplomata the game to you!\nThis cross platform multiplayer browser based strategy game is really worth giving it a try! Diplomata takes place in the end of the 21st century, after the collapse of the human civilization we know.\nThe boundaries of the once-existed states have stayed the same, but some countries became more powerful than others. A player has to strive to build a country that’s wealthier than others, knowing that other players will try to achieve the same goal. So, it’s up to a player to use everything from diplomacy to war to develop the most powerful country. This is a turn-based game and a player gets 3 turns in every minutes (300 turns is maximum, though). Turns are made for developing of the country (improving industry, agriculture or building objects) and for interaction with allies and enemies (sending help, attacking, secret service actions etc.).\nEvery player has enough time to analyze, think and plan before they make a turn. Plus, having equal number of turns enables equal game. Diplomata is also played in rounds with every round lasting one month and first day in the next month every player starts from zero, which gives all players opportunity to plan new round from the very beginning and, of course, to take revenge on enemies. If you like games that require both social and strategy skills and allow players to team up with other players or compete against them, Diplomata might be an ideal strategy game for you. With hundreds (and counting) players from all around the globe, this game promises a rewarding gaming experience. It’s perfect for those players who don’t fancy downloading or installing anything in order to play games, since it’s fully browser based.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Ofanziva"],"publishers":["Ofanziva"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1477958400,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jjlmuzywloxcjwxslpgz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":44159,"name":"Dinosis Survival","summary":"Dinosis Survival is a TPS with dinosaurs based on a mysterious story.

Although the visuals are less rough and friendlier than its contemporary counterparts, the difficulty is very unforgiving. DJ Boy has only four life bars and when they are gone, the game is over without continues. Defeated enemies leave behind coins. At the end of each stage the coins can be exchanged for a skateboard, a stronger punch or other items.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":633830400,"platforms":["Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uqz3dnv42lm0zzgcfhuw.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1201985985","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Disk%20Jockey%20Boy"}]},{"igdb_id":46233,"name":"Disney's Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Quest","summary":"Play as Belle from Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" and (loosely) follow the animated film's story.

These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived. \n\nFeatures: \n◦ Connect points by numbers or letters \n◦ When points are connected, you will see the silhouette of a hidden picture \n◦ Once all the points have been connected, you can color the picture \n◦ Choosing a wrong symbol three times in a row will bring up a tip \n◦ Blue, orange, green or pink stars make the game even more exciting \n◦ Easy-to-use palette that allows you to put together your own unique set of colors \n◦ Colored pictures automatically saved on closing the program\n\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1418774400,"platforms":["Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcdogqfpcgzx0ppzm0y6.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"949481721","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dinosaurs-connect-the-dots-and-add-colors/id949481721?mt=12&uo=4"},{"category":13,"store":"microsoft","uid":"949481747","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dinosaurs-connect-the-dots-and-add-colors-free/id949481747?mt=12&uo=4"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"342039335","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dinosaurs%20-%20Connect%20the%20Dots%20and%20Add%20Colors"}]},{"igdb_id":86770,"name":"Diabolic","summary":"The game is set in a dark pixel fantasy world.

As they explore the world, they will encounter situations based on basic English (such as word puzzles), compass reading, telling the time and learning to read a map's scale.

This journal provides insight into the professor's journey throughout the game's various environments. It also talks of his meeting with the hermit, and how he succumbs to illness. The final entry is in different handwriting from the rest of the journal, and is by the hermit, who writes that the professor died the previous night and that he has buried him in the desert.","genres":["Puzzle","Quiz/Trivia","Adventure"],"developers":["4Mation Educational Resources Ltd","Brian Christmas"],"publishers":["Jacaranda Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["BBC Microcomputer System","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co301x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":109194,"name":"Disney's The Lion King II: Simba's Pride","summary":"Disney's The Lion King II: Simba's Pride contains four different games: labyrinth, breakout, a rhythm game and a simple shooter.

The game screen is divided in small tiles and the player gets to pick and place dinosaurs, and put a fence around them. Every day a certain number of visitors arrives and the player needs to make sure they do not get hurt when the dinosaurs break out of their fenced enclosure. For each day that the zoo survives without being run down by trampling dinos, the player receives income and gets access to new types of dinosaurs. After the first week new goals are offered when you do not put up new fences, make sure that less visitors die than the day before, or survive a PETA inspection. While placing the dinosaurs and putting down fences, the game is paused. When done, everything comes to life for about ten seconds and then a tally is made. Generally the player cannot interfere during those seconds, except with some emergency measures.\n\nEach dino has specific characteristics. Some can sit together, while others need to stay away from each other. Certain dinosaurs need lots of space and others get angry when too many fences surround them. Once they get angry, they knock down fences, attack other dinosaurs and eat visitors. When this happens too often, the game is over.

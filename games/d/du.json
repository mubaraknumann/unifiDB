[{"igdb_id":35,"name":"Dungeon Keeper","summary":"Dungeon Keeper is a strategy video game in which the player attempts to build and manage a dungeon or lair while protecting it from invading 'hero' characters intent on stealing the player's accumulated treasures and killing various monsters. This was Peter Molyneux's final project with Bullfrog before he left the company in August 1997 to form Lionhead Studios.\n\nThe player uses a mouse, represented in-game as a hand, to interact with a bar on the left-hand side of the screen, allowing them to select which rooms to build and which spells to cast. The player can also use the hand to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon and carry them around, allowing for tactics such as gathering an assault force and dropping off the creatures en masse once a foothold has been established. The hand also allows the player to \"slap\" objects and thereby interact with them: creatures will hurry up when slapped, some traps will be triggered and prisoners in the Torture Chamber can be tortured.\n\nThe main game view is in isometric perspective; this view can be zoomed and rotated. The player also has the option of possessing one of their creatures, and seeing the dungeon from that creature's first-person perspective, as well as using their attacks and abilities. The map is divided into a grid of rectangles, most of which are invisible. A smaller part of the map is shown as a minimap in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nA world map is also available, and at the beginning of the game the player is allocated one of the 20 regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each of which represents a level of the game, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. Before starting a new level, the Mentor will tell the player about the current region and its attributes. After completing a level, the Mentor will talk about the \"improvement\" of the destroyed region: \"The streets run with the blood of the slain. Screams of pain and howls of anguish rip the night air like a vengeful siren's song. This really is somewhere you can take the kids for the weekend.\"\n\nThe Dungeon Heart represents the Dungeon Keeper's own link to the world. If it is destroyed, the player loses the level, and must restart. Along with the heart, the player begins with a small number of imps, the generic work force for all dungeon activities: they can dig tunnels into the surrounding soil, capture enemy rooms and Portals, mine gold and gems, set traps, and even attack when desperate or threatened. Slapping creatures forces them to work faster for a while, but removes some of their health and happiness.\n\nOnce the Imps are busily working, the player must then set up a basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food for the minions, are bred), and a Treasury for storing gold. After connecting the dungeon to a \"Portal\", monsters will arrive. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms.\n\nThe dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: some creatures are natural enemies. Flies and Spiders are often found at odds with one another, while a Horned Reaper, if it has gone berserk, will attack all creatures in its path. The goals for each level are fairly straightforward: they generally fall along the lines of eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers on the level.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"developers":["Bullfrog Productions"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":10.0,"release_date":867283200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3wg6.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"9PKDX735TR8K","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/-1-/9PKDX735TR8K"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"17620","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-17620/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"16169","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dungeon Keeper"}]},{"igdb_id":36,"name":"Dungeon Keeper 2","summary":"Like its predecessor, players take the role of a dungeon keeper, building and defending an underground dungeon from the would-be heroes that invade it, as well as from other keepers.

Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.\n\nThe single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"developers":["Westwood Studios"],"publishers":["Virgin Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":723168000,"platforms":["Acorn Archimedes","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4vw0.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"13070","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"14236","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-14236/"}]},{"igdb_id":87,"name":"Dune 2000","summary":"Real-time strategy taking place in Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" universe.

Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view.\n\nAbstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["FTL Games"],"publishers":["Psygnosis","JVC Musical Industries","FTL Games","Victor Musical Industries"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":566524800,"platforms":["Apple IIGS","Sharp X68000","Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Atari ST/STE","DOS","FM Towns","Amiga","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21zj.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"18518","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18518/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"16971","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dungeon Master"}]},{"igdb_id":3799,"name":"Dungeon Master: Chaos Strikes Back","summary":"Chaos Strikes Back is an expansion and sequel to Dungeon Master, the earlier 3D real-time action role-playing video game.

The two Clerics and two Magic Users also have subtle differences within their spell books.\n\nThe controls are using four buttons: Attack, Jump, Select (brings up a small inventory ring around the character allowing the player to choose what item is set in the Use slot) and Use. The Cleric, Elf and Magic-User also have two extra rings for their spells, with the Jump button used to switch from ring to ring. While the game uses the same kick harness as the previous game, the Select and Use buttons are reversed.\n\nShadow over Mystara also introduced a selection of special moves which are executed by moving the joystick and tapping the buttons in certain combinations, in a way similar to the Street Fighter series. The characters (except for the Magic-User) have a Dashing Attack as well as a Rising Attack which can be used to combo monsters or even juggle them in the air. Most characters (again, with the exception of the Magic-User and also Cleric) also have a Megacrush, a move common to nearly all of Capcom side-scrollers, which damages all enemies standing close enough to the character but in turn also damaging the player themselves.","genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":75.0,"release_date":851990400,"platforms":["Arcade","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Sega Saturn"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25p3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":10254,"name":"Dungeon Siege III: Treasures of the Sun","summary":"In Dungeon Siege III: Treasures of the Sun, players will extend their journey and travel beyond the borders of Ehb to an all-new environment: the Aranoi Desert.

For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch.

Pong","summary":"Dual Pong has a more methodical gameplay style than the original Pong game. Players have to focus not only on their defense, but also on their offense if they want to improve their chances of winning. The player's offense is determined by which key or button the player presses while a ball is colliding with their paddle. This gives the player more control over which hitting techniques they use in different situations during the game. The versatile controls in this game allow the player to control the offense in a variety of both familiar and unfamiliar ways. Players can choose and change up their controls on the fly by deciding which combination of keys or buttons they want to use in real-time.\n\nWith the exception of the Classic Pong game event, all of the rest of the game events in this game requires the player to focus their defense and offense on 2 balls during gameplay instead of just one. This can create situations where the player can be on offense and defense at the same time, and it can also create situations where the player might be temporarily overwhelmed by 2 balls moving towards their side of the screen at the same time; which can possibly become more difficult to deal with depending on whether or not certain ball collisions happen during these situations. There are 16 possible ball collisions that can happen when the 2 balls collide with each other. These possible ball collisions are determined by which direction the 2 balls are moving in, and also what speed the 2 balls are moving at when they collide with each other. There are also other possible collisions that can happen (even during the Classic Pong game event) when a ball collides with a paddle; which can either result in the ball \"staying in play\" or \"going out of play\". Players will only be able to use their offense on a ball if it stays in play.\n\nThe AI will adapt to the player's skill level based on how well the player is performing in the game. Although the AI can adapt to the player's skill level, the AI will never become unbeatable. The player just needs to figure out a way to beat the AI. If the player figures out a way to beat the AI in each of the game events, they can choose to play against other players who have done the same in order to find their next level of challenge. The AI in this game is smart and was designed to have a similar play style to some of the players. The AI is also capable of making split decisions when necessary. In addition to a smart and adaptive AI, this game also has some hidden in-game strategies and easter eggs; but I want the players to discover them on their own.","genres":["Sport","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1462924800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29sa.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":30,"store":"itch","uid":"66185","url":"https://randomess-dj-p.itch.io/dual-pong"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"636760522","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dual%20Pong"}]},{"igdb_id":135280,"name":"Dust Dasher","summary":"A doomed cowboy runs through the desert, pursued by a mystic worm.","genres":["Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Rémy \"Trasevol_Dog\" Devaux"],"publishers":["Rémy \"Trasevol_Dog\" Devaux"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1467244800,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2duh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":135414,"name":"Dungeon and Gravestone","summary":"Death and resurrection, death and resurrection.

The game was in development by Marigul and Media Factory and probably it would have been published by Nintendo. The player had to collect a series of cards to use them in combat as in Magic The Gatering.\n\nDT 64 was shown at the Space World 1999 in a non-playable form: there was just a logo and some text , with the GameBoy Link Cable, that would have been used to connect the two Nintendo consoles. The GameBoy could have been used as a controller for the 64DD game, to check the card statistics and share data with a presumed Bloodmaster GB version. The two games, one for the 64DD and one for the GB, would had exchanged data to integrate parts of the story and unlock new levels / cards. Players would have been able to play online with the 64DD Randnet Network, to trade cards and complete their collection.\n\nIn a scan from a Japanese magazine, we can read: “A controller with a brain.” Even if the translation is not accurate because an ideogram is hide by the reflection of the light, making it unrecognizable, the concept is certainly intriguing. Sadly DT64 was cancelled and it vanished without any more screens or info.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Marigul Management","Media Factory"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["64DD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co854e.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":341123,"name":"DTET","summary":"Doujin Tetris TGM by Mihys","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":357672,"name":"DTC","summary":"DTC (Defend The Cubes) is a tower defense game where you deploy units to stop enemies before they destroy the cube.

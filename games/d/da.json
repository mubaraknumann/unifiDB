It is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion. The game's plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle — a sentient, disembodied tentacle — from taking over the world. The player takes control of the three and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history.\n\nDave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, their first time in such a role. The pair carried over a limited amount of elements from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine, and the company's first title to feature voice acting.\n\nThe game was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD-ROM to critical acclaim and commercial success. Critics focused on its cartoon-style visuals and comedic elements. Day of the Tentacle has featured regularly in lists of \"top\" games published more than two decades after its release, and aspects have been referenced in popular culture.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure"],"developers":["LucasArts"],"publishers":["LucasArts"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":740966400,"platforms":["Mac","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co30yt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":657,"name":"Dark Age of Camelot","summary":"Dark Age of Camelot is a 3D medieval fantasy MMORPG that combines Arthurian lore, Norse mythology and Irish Celtic legends with a dash of high fantasy.

She will face an assortment of fantasy characters and creatures in her journeys as she makes her way through 30 missions set across five different game worlds.

Each miniboss has a small, circular ball placed on them that, after receiving enough damage, will detach and float away, causing the miniboss to turn idle. If the player collects the ball, the miniboss will follow and aid the player. After a brief period of time, or the player loses a life, the miniboss will explode.\n\nA few months following release, update to the arcade version was later released entitled \"Darius Gaiden Extra Edition\".

The second addition is the council board which allows the player to influence the city council in his or enemy cities even allowing him to conquer an enemy without using any military strength. Of course this features is also available to the enemies so the player needs to make sure he holds at least three of five seats in his city council in order to prevent a hostile take-over.\n\nThe add-on also adds an all-new multiplayer-mode for up to eight players to the game. The players can either play against each other, form teams or play Coop.

Coop can either be played against up to four human players or up to four AI-opponents.

As the player destroys ECDs, the charge accumulation rate is reduced, allowing more time for the player to complete the mission. \n \nThe game's environment is displayed in first person view with the player seeing the world through the suit's helmet. A targeting crosshair displayed in the helmet's HUD allowing the player to fire the suit's weapon at specific locations. The player can move in all directions by walking or activating the jetpack. The suit is powered by an energy source that gets depleted with every movement and it is allocated between \"shields\" and \"fuel\". When the shields charge is depleted, the player is vulnerable to enemy fire and simply bumping into walls can end the game. Fuel is vital for horizontal and vertical movement and the game ends as soon as its depleted. There are a number of \"recharge\" points (in the form of columns) hidden in the game where the player can replenish the suit's energy supply. There are also a number of energy conversion devices that allow transforming shield energy to fuel and vice versa.","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Major Developments"],"publishers":["Micro Status","Incentive Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":599529600,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nuwymgwlyw3h5861vetl.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6686","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-6686/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"6114","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dark%20Side"}]},{"igdb_id":12344,"name":"Dan Kitchen's Tomcat: The F-14 Fighter Simulator","summary":"Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.\n\nYour cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!\n\nThe gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing.

Further, the lands of Atlantis are accessible from every realm, but every realm has its \"own\" Atlantis, so there are no Player vs. Player fights. \n \nThe Addon also contains one new race for each of the three realms (The half-ogres for Albion, the Shars for Hibernia and the Frostalfs for Midgard) and an even more improved graphics engine, mainly giving players better textures and new water effects.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Mythic Entertainment"],"publishers":["Mythic Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":77.0,"release_date":1067299200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ym7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":23794,"name":"Dance Dance Revolution Konamix","summary":"Turn this up!

This is a different port than the title \"Darius+\", which was published by The Edge and developed by Softek for the Amiga, Atart ST, and ZX Spectrum.\n\nAmidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\n\nYes, fish.\n\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\n\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\n\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\n\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\n\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\n\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\n\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:\n- Darius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\n\n- Darius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\n\n- Super Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a \"boss rush\" mode.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Bits Laboratory"],"publishers":["NEC Avenue","Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":640224000,"platforms":["Wii","TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","PC Engine SuperGrafx","Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xwp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38145,"name":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh - Ooedo Nikki","summary":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh - Ooedo Nikki is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Act Japan and published by Taito Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1994.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Quiz/Trivia","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Act Japan"],"publishers":["Nintendo","St. GIGA","Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":785721600,"platforms":["Satellaview","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co63d4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38146,"name":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh - Doki-doki Seishun-hen","summary":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh - Doki-doki Seishun-hen is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Act Japan and published by Taito Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1993.","genres":["Simulator","Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":["Act Japan"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":743990400,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3c8l.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38261,"name":"Daikaijuu Monogatari","summary":"In this clone of Dragon Quest, there are a series of natural disasters that are devastating the planet; causing the great Demon King Fattobajah to emerge from his elemental shell-induced slumber.

Changes include a boss rush mode (via a code) and various modifications to levels and mechanics, such as the boss Steel Spine being moved to another level and the boss Killer Higia being replaced with a similar creation called Nehonojia. This conversion does not support two players, so the ability to choose between Proco Jr. and Tiat Young was added; Proco plays like normal, while Tiat starts every life off with one power level to every weapon.\n\nA Master System conversion, developed by Natsume, was released in Europe and Brazil in 1992, also titled Sagaia. It is somewhat based on the Mega Drive port, and while Tiat Young and her abilities are still present (though even more limited), many zones (and thus bosses) have been completely removed.\n\nThe Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito","Tec Toy","Sega"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":620611200,"platforms":["Arcade","Wii","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Sega Saturn","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2eyh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":39863,"name":"Daioh","summary":"Daioh (Great King) is an arcade game developed by Athena Co.

Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across.

Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete.

This game is the ninth release in North America, but despite having the same name as its Japanese counterpart, its gameplay and soundtrack is significantly different[1] and won the Video Music Awards in 2005 on MTV for Best Video Game Soundtrack.\n\nWhile the PlayStation 2 version came out in North America, the arcade version was exclusive to Japan. Despite this, the arcade version was exported to many arcades in the USA (most of them being bootlegged). Dance Dance Revolution Extreme was the last game in the DDR arcade franchise for four years until Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles. Konami issued an in-game thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced a rejuvenation of the entire series, but did not go into details. Konami's announcement led people to believe that DDR Extreme might be the final DDR release or that the series might be on hiatus or rebooted in the same manner as Beatmania and Beatmania IIDX.","genres":["Music","Arcade"],"developers":["Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo","Bemani"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1040774400,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5eg5.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3019","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3280","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-3280/"}]},{"igdb_id":43746,"name":"Dancing Stage EuroMix","summary":"Dancing Stage EuroMix is the 2nd release of the Dancing Stage series, the European version of Dance Dance Revolution series of music video games by Konami.

A handful of survivors escape to the jungle and start working on a counter attack - but they are soon discovered and are now running out of time, and they must launch the Daisenpū squadron before it is fully operational. The player takes control of a fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy territory, attack ground targets such as tanks, turrets and warships (the game curiously doesn't feature any flying enemies and no obstacles to fly into, beside enemy bullets). The plane starts equipped with a limited double-shot machine gun that can be slowly upgraded throughout the game by collecting power-pods left behind by small trucks. But the originality of Daisenpū lies elsewhere - the player can call a small squadron of six planes and have them fly in formation, shooting anything in sight and crashing into an enemy unit when defeated. The squadron can also commit a Kamikaze attack at anytime and destroy ground units, or combine to release a devastative bomb-attack. Finally, Daisenpū offers an unusual feature - levels do not pause between them and reveal instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":726969600,"platforms":["TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6xdx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"1932992149","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dai%20Senpu"}]},{"igdb_id":44414,"name":"Daikaijuu Monogatari II","summary":"Daikaijuu Monogatari II is a role-playing video game developed by Birthday and published by Hudson Soft for Super Famicom, in August 1996 in Japan.\n\nThe game is a sequel of Daikaijuu Monogatari.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["AIM Productions"],"publishers":["Hudson Soft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":838944000,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4cxw.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"459632","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Daikaijuu%20Monogatari%20II"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"45532","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-45532/"}]},{"igdb_id":44415,"name":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh","summary":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh is a Miscellaneous game, published by Taito Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1992.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Quiz/Trivia","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["Taito"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725241600,"platforms":["Satellaview","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co76g1.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"458542","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Daibakushou:%20Jinsei%20Gekijoh"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"44402","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-44402/"}]},{"igdb_id":44416,"name":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh - Zukkoke Salaryman-hen","summary":"Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijoh - Zukkoke Salaryman-hen is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Act Japan and published by Taito Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1995.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Act Japan"],"publishers":["Taito"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820195200,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/woalydifs4iypuorqm1e.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"497475","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Daibakushou:%20Jinsei%20Gekijoh%20-%20Zukkoke%20Salaryman-hen"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"55332","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-55332/"}]},{"igdb_id":44420,"name":"Daisenryaku Expert WWII: War in Europe","summary":"Daisenryaku Expert WWII: War in Europe is a Strategy game, developed by SystemSoft and published by ASCII Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1996.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["SystemSoft"],"publishers":["ASCII Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":841363200,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3sp9.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"58712","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-58712/"},{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"496163","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Daisenryaku%20Expert%20WWII:%20War%20in%20Europe"}]},{"igdb_id":44421,"name":"Daisenryaku Expert","summary":"Daisenryaku Expert is a Strategy game, developed by SystemSoft and published by ASCII Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1992.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["SystemSoft"],"publishers":["ASCII Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":717379200,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4cv2.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"44362","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-44362/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"458504","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Daisenryaku%20Expert"}]},{"igdb_id":44536,"name":"Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours - Limited Edition","summary":"DARIUSBURST Chronicle Saviours is the latest installment in Taito's DARIUS series of arcade-style shooting games.

The player may play against the computer or another human on a strategic game board. In the beginning of the game, the player buys their forces with a predefined number of credits, and may purchase any of the 16 characters along with various kinds of traps and even rings of power to upgrade their creatures. One is chosen to be the \"Orb Keeper\". The Orb Keeper is like the King in chess: the game is over if he dies. Then players set up on a chosen map and start to move turn wise. When one player moves a piece into the same square as an opponent, the action is instantly transferred to another board map that represents the terrain upon which the two pieces occupy. Each player starts with their single piece on this \"melee map\" and must fight using their figures. The fight is simultaneously controlled in real time.\n\nEach figure type has unique abilities and at least two attack types. They can be roughly translated into categories however. This categories facing off against each other is the main focus of strategy. Simply put: Casters are hunted by Undead which are hunted by Fighters that fear the Casters spells. These categories are made up as a description and not an inherent part of the game. Hence some odd figures don't fit in any category.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Silicon Knights"],"publishers":["Strategic Simulations","SNEG"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":765158400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fmgxkbgjj3cqxx3pehg6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":50813,"name":"Dawn of the Saviours","summary":"Dawn of the Saviours is in early Alpha Testing.

Darkfall: New Dawn is a licensing project rebooting the original game and then will continue to improve its functionalities until it reaches its full potential.\n\nDesign wise, New Dawn will stay true to the dream that was sold before the original launch, while picking up the good aspects of what the game ended up being years later. Our focus being to create a meaningful empire building game where sandbox features and PvP are just tools to an end.\n\nDarkfall Online boasts impressive technology that has yet to be equaled in the industry, providing large scale battles with projectile calculation and player collisions in a seamless open world.\n\nTrue Action Combat\n\nMost of the game is played in first person view, for archery and magic, and a close third person view for melee combat. It has naval combat, mounted combat and an heroic fantasy version of tanks.\nYou could compare Darkfall to an MMOFPS, but with a living, breathing, virtual world.\n\nCharacters in Darkfall are completely free of restrictions. This is a game without classes that offered a multitude of skills and spells that increased with use and let players feel the limit of their own abilities. There are no mages, warriors or rangers, only combatants that use whatever tools they can to reach victory.\n\nLarge Scale Warfare\n\nAnd victory is of the utmost importance, as Darkfall is an open PvP full loot game, where equipment pieces are consumable commodities rather than a traditional “best in slot”. War in Agon is just as much about economy than it is about fame and glory.\n\nDarkfall pits three asymmetric racial alliances over the control of Agon. In traditional heroic fantasy fashion, the Humans, Elves and Dwarves are allies. Against them are the Orks and Mahirims, a race of wolfmen. And finally, standing alone, are the cave dwelling creations of a living god: the Alfars.\nThis racial war aspect, and the alignment system, balances the harshness of the world, as you almost always find shelter amongst your kin.\n\nHowever, where Darkfall shines the most is in its conquest and clan driven political system. The game is comprised of capturable holdings and villages where players can create a home and influence the day to day lives of each other through war, alliances, sieges and trade.\nA lot of these features were at the first step of implementation and aside from the combat aspect, Darkfall was rather incomplete. New Dawn will finish and expand Darkfall to make it the ultimate empire building game, but also a game where players can act as their own agent and have meaningful daily activities.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["Ub3rgames"],"publishers":["Ub3rgames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1516924800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2pus.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"494250","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Darkfall: New Dawn"},{"category":3,"store":"store_3","uid":"55086","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-55086/"}]},{"igdb_id":57103,"name":"Daily Chthonicle","summary":"This game lets you try on the role of a Supernatural Newspaper Agency boss and editor.

It was released in the arcades by Konami on October 30, 1999. Although only officially released in Japan, units exist worldwide. It has a total of 68 songs, 35 of which were new to Dance Dance Revolution.\n\nThe core gameplay of 3rdMix is the same as the previous Dance Dance Revolution games. 3rdMix featured a brand new scoring system, instead of being heavily combo-based like the last two mixes, combos are of virtually no importance. The maximum score for each song is 10,000,000 (all Perfects). Perfects are worth twice as many points as Greats, and steps toward the end are worth progressively higher points than steps toward the beginning. In nonstop mode, a 2x, 3x and 4x multiplier apply to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th songs respectively, making a perfect nonstop worth 100,000,000 points.\n\n3rdMix was also the first version of DDR where different beats (compared to a 4-beat register) alternate different colors, making 1/4, 1/8, 1/12 and 1/16 steps look different and making it easier for the player to recognize changing rhythms. This color scheme is called \"vivid\" mode, whereby the old scheme of all arrows being the same color is henceforth referred to as \"flat\" mode. Flat appears as an option and modifier in later versions of DDR.\n\nThis release marked the first time lyrics were displayed during gameplay for every song. This can be turned on or off by the arcade operator.

In order to exorcise the demon, they need to find the missing ritual components and bring them back to the alter. Their only alternative is hiding and surviving until the dawn, when the sunlight will purge the demon from the grounds. They can use fire, which hurts the demon, or weapons and tools hidden around the island to their advantage. While the demon can’t be killed, he can be crippled, stalled and distracted. \nThe demon is played in the third person, needs to simply slaughter all the humans and prevent them from finishing the ritual. He is fast, agile, powerful and deadly. \n \nThe humans are stronger when they band together, but they are easier to find. Stay together or split up to avoid ending up in a group with a demon – it is for you to choose. \n \nWill you go for the missing ritual parts, or just try to hide until dawn? Will you help the others, or just be a lone wolf – the game leaves that up to you. \n \nWhen a player dies in the game, their soul gets separated from their body and they can float around the map in the shape of a glowing ball of light. He can light the way for the players, find the demon and follow him so the others can see where he is, or just lead the others to his body so they can be revived. \n \nDaemonical also features a positional voice chat, so you can tell the other players that are close to you your plan, or pick a strategy together, but be careful!

Points are awarded for accuracy with bonus multipliers awarded for making certain 'combos' (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long). This is a game for one or two players with three difficulty settings, easy, hard and medium. The player selects their difficulty level and their track and then attempts to score points by hitting the correct buttons in sequence. During the song the player is treated to an distant view of an animated disco dancer on a stage and illuminated with coloured lights. Once the track is over the player can enter their name, assuming they have achieved a high score. The game holds eight scores for each of the three difficulty levels but no scores are recorded for Workout and Recorder modes. The game has a workout mode in which the player first enters their weight, in kilograms, and then selects a track. Gameplay here is basically the same as the main game but instead of points the game calculates the number of calories burned. There is no difficulty setting for this game mode and the arrows come thick and fast. The Recorder option allows the player to create and save their own dance, there is no high score for this and while the dance moves are preserved from one game to the next only one routine can be saved. Songs included in this game are: Merry Christmas Everyone: Shakin' Stevens Don't Cha: Pussycat Dolls The Grid: Diablo Movin' On Up: M People Atlantic Ocean: Waterfall Killin' Time: Tina Cousins Push the Button: Sugarbabes Dancin: Aaron Smith feat.

There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points.

And in 2010, IGN's Craig Harris said in a podcast that he had seen a complete script for Metroid Dread, and that \"Nintendo could use it anytime they wanted.\" It's possible that this was the synopsis that Liam Robertson was referring to.

In it, you control main character Merit, who travels through an enormous 3000-room labyrinth, the Orcus Dome, in order to find three artifacts called the PSI Keys, and restore them to their proper locations. \n \nAlthough enemies fire copious amounts of bullets at you, you don't shoot back- instead, you have an attack called a PSI Circuit, which you charge up to unleash a shockwave that hits enemies and nullifies their shots. As you charge up the PSI Circuit, target reticules appear on nearby enemies, the circle indicating they're in range, and the cross indicating you've charged up enough to damage or kill them. You can't just use the PSI Circuit as often as you want, though. After releasing it, there's a cooldown time before you can charge up again, and the longer you charge up, the longer you have to wait.

On their way these survivors get involved in a chain of bloodbath engagements and find themselves in the dead center of the well-known Tet offensive.\n\nMissions range from special operations to full scale battles.","genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy","Tactical"],"developers":["Best Way"],"publishers":["Lace Mamba Global"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1315440000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3nte.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":368579,"name":"Metal Crisis","summary":"Pushed to their limits by the Earth government, the space colonies began a rebellion.

A power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply, sparking an invasion that turns the country into a warzone. But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. Mercenaries 2 features a slew of potential clients, all willing to pay you to do their dirty work. Dirty deeds, done for exorbitant fees. These are world powers with deep pockets, deep grudges, and enough arms and ammo to start World War III. This is your kind of environment. Mercenaries 2 features the latest and most dangerous in civilian and military tech, everything from shiny new sports cars, to the future-tech satellite-guided bunker-busting mini-nuke. Tanks, APCs, boats, luxury automobiles - you name it, you can have it delivered to you in real time. And if you run out of cash you can always 'acquire' the gear you need in the field. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow the living crap out of it. Play your own way, or play with the help of a friend in the new cooperative multiplayer mode. You are not a soldier. You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. Not everyone in the world of Mercenaries is as honorable. Everyone will try and screw you, given the chance. They think they can get away with it, because they don't know rule #1: EVERYBODY PAYS.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Pandemic Studios","Behaviour Interactive"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts"],"aggregated_rating":69.6,"release_date":1220140800,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2io6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352035,"name":"Mega Man Battle Network 4: Patch Card - 049: Buster Attack 15","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["e-Reader / Card-e Reader"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352124,"name":"Mega Man Battle Network 4: Patch Card - 127: Proto Soul","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["e-Reader / Card-e Reader"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352099,"name":"Mega Man Battle Network 4: Patch Card - 107: Weapon Change","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["e-Reader / Card-e Reader"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":369603,"name":"Memasiki 2: Oldskuly svelo","summary":"Each round offers you a picture or description of a meme, after which you need to choose the correct answer from the options offered.

The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.","genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["Kojima Productions"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":95.73684210526316,"release_date":1441065600,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1v85.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352107,"name":"Mega Man Battle Network 4: Patch Card - 113: Charge Shot Switch","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["e-Reader / Card-e Reader"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352331,"name":"Mega Man Battle Network 4: Red Sun","summary":null,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1681430400,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coant4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":372944,"name":"Meteorite Fall","summary":"Let's use existence and freedom as stakes, block everything, and explore the ancient legends of the Fallen Star Village, digging out the truth buried in the long river of history.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coao09.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352425,"name":"Mega Man Battle Network 6: Patch Card - Volcano","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352415,"name":"Mega Man Battle Network 6: Patch Card - ColdBear","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":43613,"name":"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection","summary":"Hitting store shelves in a springtime when hundreds of thousands of Hideo Kojima fans were anxiously awaiting the projected summer release of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots for PlayStation 3, this PlayStation 2 compilation is presented as an opportunity to catch up on back story, as well as to play (or re-play) through three of the earlier PlayStation consoles' most highly acclaimed stealth games.

Originally released in 1998 for the PlayStation, the game follows Sir Daniel Fortesque, a skeletal knight accidentally resurrected to battle the sorcerer Zarok and save the kingdom of Gallowmere.\n\nThe game takes place across a variety of levels, many of which require certain objectives to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\n\nDan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan's health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player fills it with enough souls from defeated enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a legendary hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the game's true ending is revealed.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["SCE Cambridge Studio"],"publishers":["Sony Interactive Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1713225600,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co84x3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":371824,"name":"Merry Bunny Garden","summary":"Tipsy-walking Action Game\nA spin-off of the \"Bunny Garden\" that charmed gentlemen across the world, is available now as an action game!\nControl \"woozy\" cast members who can't walk properly and return home avoiding dangers that await!\nYour mission is to safely escort these \"woozy\" cast members home!","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["qureate"],"publishers":["qureate"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1759968000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coamo2.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":6455,"name":"Me & My Katamari","summary":"The King of All Cosmos and the Royal Family decide to take some time off from their celestial construction and travel to Earth for a well-earned (for the Prince at least) tropical summer vacation on their own sunny island.

The goal is to terminate Crocomire in the Dissolvery, which is locked behind 4 Security Locks, (Similar to Fusion) however one unique thing that this ROM hack does it that you have a great choice of which order you want to do things in. You could get Space Jump before even touching the Varia Suit, get the Plasma Beam as your second beam upgrade, everything is possible if you’re clever enough.\n\nThe major items also move around during a “CORE-X” playthrough, (This game’s equivalent to Hard Mode) granting even greater replay value, especially to get those nice ending pictures. And yes indeed, the player sprites have been changed to those of the SA-X from Fusion, making the hack the second one to ever have custom Samus graphics in Zero Mission. The length of the hack is pretty short, (Around 2 hours) but going through all the endings and exploring the different paths of every difficulty could more than quadruple that. A full map is included with the download, with two different styles (And two different ones to reflect the changes in Hard Mode)\n\nThere are also other various ASM tweaks thanks to the talented ASM hackers of Metroid Construction, such as the Crocomire final boss being very close to Super Metroid’s, and the Fusion beams being ported back into Zero Mission.\n\nSo if you are looking for a refreshing Zero Mission hack with a Super Metroid vibe, this hack is for you!","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Metroid Construction"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1694908800,"platforms":["Game Boy Advance"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co93hr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352953,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Battle Chip - Recovery150","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352963,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Battle Chip - ThunderBall","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":353050,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Battle Chip - CP 3 (Barrier 100)","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352986,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Navi Chip - MegaMan","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":353045,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Battle Chip - CP 4 Quick Gauge","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352997,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Navi Chip - Searchman","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352955,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Battle Chip - Recovery300","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352985,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Battle Chip - CP 8 (Blue Moon Ray)","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":353029,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Battle Chip - CP 2 (Side Bamboo 1)","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":352994,"name":"MegaMan NT Warrior Advanced PET: Navi Chip - Windman","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":346896,"name":"Mess","summary":"MESS is a multiplayer first-person jailbreak game where strategy, deception, and survival collide in a prison environment.

It was the first game in the Metal Gear series for the PSP. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile.\n\nAcid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character's movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \"Active Command Intelligence Duel\". The cards are not truly collectable, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs.\n\nBefore each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. Most cards are based on elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player's hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher.\n\nCost is an important factor in gameplay and can be summed up as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 15 and a guard has a cost of 10, then the guard's turn would occur before the character's.\n\nSome cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped.

As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.\n\nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"developers":["Capcom Japan"],"publishers":["Capcom Japan"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":945993600,"platforms":["Game Boy Color"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9s03.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":348349,"name":"Memoria Wake","summary":"Battle nightmares in the dream world as you unravel reflections of the past in Memoria Wake, an isometric souls-like action-adventure game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9yaz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":327016,"name":"Mercenaries 3: No Limits","summary":"Mercenaries 3: No Limits was the working title of a video game being developed by Pandemic Studios.

If the player is seen, the game enters the \"Alert Mode.\" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:\n\nIf Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.\nHowever, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.\nThe player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.\n\nThe enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.\n\nA transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them.

PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014.\n\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034, the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length.\n\nInitially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012; it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver.\n\nMetro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["4A Games"],"publishers":["Deep Silver"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1371168000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frf6syzr0hhe8qjp2rui.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":89016,"name":"Mega Man Mobile","summary":"Play a piece of gaming history with the original Mega Man, the action-packed classic platformer!\nIn the year 200X, six robots created by master roboticist Dr. Light are tampered with by the evil genius Dr. Wily, and go on a destructive rampage!\nOnly one robot remains who can put a stop to Wily’s plans and restore world peace: the heroic Mega Man.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1475280000,"platforms":["iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3z0f.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":1726,"name":"Mega Man & Bass","summary":"Mega Man & Bass is an entry in the classic Mega Man series, with option for controlling either Mega Man or Bass, due to Dr. Wily and Dr. Light making a truce to fight against King.

While the basic gameplay is identical in design, controlling with a gamepad instead of the touch-screen & Stylus pair makes it a different game. It consists of a board where coloured meteos plummet towards a planet's atmosphere. There, they form columns that the user can manipulate. The player moves a red cursor with two buttons to slide the meteos up or down. When three or more are lined up horizontally or vertically, they turn into ignited stone and are launched into space (the top of the screen) boosted by rockets. There they also catch all incoming meteos and often chain combos together. Ignitions based on vertical matches provide a more powerful ignition. As a group catches more incoming meteos, it becomes heavier and gravity pulls it down. The player can avoid that by causing secondary ignitions, either directly in the group or from below. If meteos can be lifted past the top of the screen, they fall down into the opponent's board. The game is over when a player's board is filled up entirely.\n\nAn additional button can be used to speed up time, creating time bombs to be sent into the opponent's board to cause an explosion. Meteos can also turn into ash and drop back down. When there is a full gauge at the bottom of the screen a planet impact can be caused. There are four types (Armageddon, Gambit, Sentinel and Tempest) each with different effects. Respectively, they lower the attack power, send more meteos while receiving less, fire a meteos missile, and fire lasers to clear away falling meteos as an additional means of defense.\n\nThe single-player has three game modes: a versus battle against the computer, mission mode, and attack mode. In the mission mode different planets need to be defeated before reaching Meteo. It is possible to unlock new planets and accessories along the way. Multiplayer against a human player is available both offline and online.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":65.0,"release_date":1228867200,"platforms":["Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2kfn.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":377,"name":"Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake","summary":"Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake is an action-adventure stealth video game created and published by Konami for the MSX2 computer platform.

However, his son, General Choi Song, and the military clique under his leadership, strongly disagreed with the old man's views. Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world.\n\nEventually, plans of a nuclear reactor construction began to surface. China, South Korea, the Allied Nations and even the Russian Mafia sent troops to North Korea, competing for power in the troubled region. A bounty of a hundred million dollars for General Song was declared. This is where the mercenaries enter the playfield.\n\nMercenaries: Playground of Destruction is a free-roaming war action and driving game with open-ended gameplay in a large world. The player can choose to control any of the three mercenary protagonists, each with their own strengths: North American Chris Jacobs can sustain higher damage; Jennifer Mui from Hong-Kong is proficient in stealth; Mattias Nilsson from Sweden can run faster than the others. Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.\n\nPlayers have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the \"Deck of 52\", a list of most wanted criminals in North Korea, as well as a number of factions. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck.\n\nPlayers have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done. It is possible to commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game's destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside. Helping out various factions provides access to numerous vehicle drops, supply drops, and air strikes.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Pandemic Studios"],"publishers":["LucasArts"],"aggregated_rating":70.8,"release_date":1105401600,"platforms":["Xbox","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ox1.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12312,"name":"Megamania","summary":"In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.\nGameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title \"Astro Blaster\". Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an \"Energy\" meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.\n\nWhen Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac.

Battles may occur during missions, which take a semi-automated turn-based format.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Strategy","Tactical","Adventure","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Tenky Co."],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":929577600,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9opg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":139631,"name":"Mesmer","summary":"A unique revolution simulator where every encounter matters.

So go out and fire up Merchant Kingdom when you move around in real life. Try and put a settlement on all the places that you visit regularly such as your home, your work place, train stations, the supermarket or your favorite bar!\nThis app works best on an iPhone with 3G access allowing you to roam and settle different locations. An iPod connected to WiFi will restrict the growth of your Kingdom.\n\nEXPAND YOUR EMPIRE\nMerchant Kingdom starts you off as a simple merchant. Found your first settlements to produce basic goods in places you visit often, and then begin your rise to power. Your iPhone is the caravan you can use to buy commodities from traders, take them with you when you move around in real life, and sell at a profit.\n\nDIPLOMACY OR TYRANNY\nAs your trading empire expands, you desire more than just wealth – it’s power you are longing for. When the king awards you a knighthood, you can build a castle, recruit an army and demand allegiance from other players! Alternatively, you can build your kingdom on the cultural influence of your castle and expand it by organising events.\"\n\nVARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE\nClaim locations you visit often and build settlements that produce the commodities you want to trade in. Upgrade your settlements whenever you can and choose from over 50 different buildings each with their own special abilities. Expand your caravan, as you get richer. Buy donkeys, settlers, horses, covered wagons, spies, thieves or one of the other units.\n\nSO MUCH TO DO, SO MUCH TO SEE\nExplore the world and discover over 40 different kinds of land types, from thick jungles, to deserts, to extinct volcanoes. On your travels, find rare commodities on your trips, then bring them home and sell them for a profit. Earn achievements in one of the four guilds: the Traders Guild, the Explorers Guild, the Manufacturers Guild or the Thieves Guild and cement your reputation in the virtual land.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Oberon Interactive"],"publishers":["Chillingo Ltd"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1287446400,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/reb08ot0yxsnfus6mlk1.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"618683184","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Merchant%20Kingdom"}]},{"igdb_id":122970,"name":"Met Rage","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2qog.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":82071,"name":"Medieval II: Total War - Collection","summary":"A steam bundle containing Medieval II: Total War and Medieval II: Total War - Kingdoms.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["The Creative Assembly"],"publishers":["Sega","Feral Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1356912000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o1vijczlvqhwljvec2gb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":102643,"name":"Meet the Letters - Uppercase","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":88831,"name":"Memory games for kids 4+","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":134852,"name":"Memoir of Phantom's Fortitude","summary":"After her mentor's disappearance, Youmu is left to uncover information about his past and the Youkai Cherry Tree, Saigyou Ayakashi.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1515542400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":126475,"name":"Medarots S: Unlimited Nova","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Imagineer"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1579737600,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5wsk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":76443,"name":"Meme Dragons","summary":"In the year 4020 humanity discovered sleeping dragons on Mars.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive.

If they reach the bottom of the screen, they will start hopping towards your spacepod if they catch your spacepod, they'll eat it. In these rounds, your spacepod fires in three directions simultaneously straight up, and 45 degrees to either side. The eight types of monsters shown in the score table attack in the order shown for the first eight waves (i.e. wave 1 is all 100-point monsters, wave 2 is all 200-point monsters, etc.) wave nine is a mass attack of all eight types, and waves ten and up are randomly-chosen from the first nine types. Each space monster round contains a total of 25 monsters, though only eight will be on the screen at any one time.\n\nThe second half of the wave starts out with a spinning space ring that drifts around the screen, growing in size if you shoot it, it splits into two smaller rings that go off in different directions and start growing again. If any ring reaches sufficient size, it will \"tractor-beam\" your spacepod into its center (your controls are frozen at this point) and then crush it. In this round, your spacepod only fires straight up the two 45-degree guns are disabled. The rings are worth the same number of points as the monsters in the first half of the waves.\n\nMEGATACK has a somewhat confusing way of indicating how many spacepods you have left. The number in the center of each pod is not a remaining lives indicator rather, it is the serial number of each pod, starting at three (or four) and descending towards one. This number does not change if you earn bonus pods rather, all of your bonus pods are numbered \"0\". Neither does the \"x spacepods remaining\" message that flashes briefly across the screen at the start of each player/pod's turn accurately reflect bonus pods rather, once you have exhausted your three standard pods, the game will repeatedly announce bonus spacepod and continue playing until you use up however many bonus pods you manage to accumulate.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Centuri"],"publishers":["Game Plan"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":347068800,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qeyw9eijjhwtpszihfkr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":193975,"name":"Metal Slug: Commander","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy","Card & Board Game"],"developers":["SNK"],"publishers":["SNK"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1629331200,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4vxq.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":105329,"name":"Mercs","summary":"Assemble a team of mercenaries and challenge the computer or another player in a quick turn-based battle.

In the process of creating monsters with this technology using an ancient creature named \"The Gods of Magic\"; it broke free of its bonds and took control of the secret facility and proceeded to slay all of the research team and arm the compounds defenses. The player is a commander in charge of the Cyborg Enforcer Teams sent into the dungeon to reclaim it. The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the games main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters.\n\nGame play[edit]\nAs the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hair style as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters. Once inside the dungeon, the players team must move around, find monsters and equipment while leveling up. A major point unsaid in game is that you are not expected to be able to beat a level's boss on the first time entering the level; as you could only allocate level up points while out of the dungeon.\n\nDungeons were randomly generated, most adhering to a typical design that made the map seem less random then it was.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["Kojima Productions"],"publishers":["Konami"],"aggregated_rating":88.625,"release_date":1320710400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation Vita","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gkj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":52292,"name":"Mercfighter","summary":"Make your assault against hundreds of waves of deadly spacecraft.

And please, leave me your comments and suggestions and concerns. For me they are fundamental, so that together we can give shape to this project and improve it day by day.\nHaving said that, I tell you a little about this project that I have started to develop with a lot of love because it brings together my two great hobbies, 3D design and writing. This graphic novel, seeks to tell the story and adventures of Bennett and the inhabitants of the village of Nemerion and their relationships, and season them with a little sex. At the moment there are 12 characters in total, most of them appear in the first chapter and some in the following chapters. I don't want to tell you much, I would like you to discover it...\nI wish to think that the novel has a balance, between History, dialogue and Sexual content, I know that it is something difficult to achieve, but I would like to be able to maintain this balance throughout the novel, and I hope that you with your comments, tell me what you think, as well as if it lacks or has more than one characteristic in particular. Although I already have a definite idea of where the novel will go and its stories, I would love to improve it together even more, 2 heads think more than 1 hahaha.\nMy plan at the moment is to be able to publish a chapter per month (if my current work allows it, since I mainly dedicate a little time every night, when I come back from work, and on weekends, as much as I can). Each month I will be improving aspects of the game, as well as developing in depth the personality and history of each character of the novel. Right now the bottleneck is given with the PC I work with, which does not allow me to render the images of the novel (it takes me an average time of 12 Hs each image, which makes it infeasible to do the work of rendering with my current PC), I can only do the layout of the images, thanks to the help of two Friends: Miguel and Gonzalo (thanks guys), who lent me their Pc's, remotely I do the work of rendering, and thus the whole project has begun to come to life. From now on my short term objective is to be able to change the PC in order to be able to make the rendering work faster and to be able to have a better quality in the images and videos of the novel.\nAs for the novel itself, I have the idea of being able to add in the lapse of the first 3 chapters:\n● An inventory, which will allow Bennett's interactions with the other characters as well as with the environment itself to be expanded.\n● A map of the village, and with it the possibility of moving freely through the village.\n● A character card, which will collect and show all the attributes of Bennett (Sexual Orientation, exploits, memories. Etc)\n● A Personal Diary of Bennett, which will show and detail our relationships with the rest of the characters in the novel\n● Videos, this point depends exclusively on whether I can change my PC, but it is something that I would like to include (I already have a video layout, but for the rendering times, I am unable to create it).\nAnd in the long run, I would like to add: Predefined Missions and Adventures that directly impact the development of Bennett's history. And to be able to launch the novel also for cell phones.\nFinal words: I hope with all my heart that you like this project and everyone can enjoy it as I am enjoying doing it, so I have decided that EVERYONE can enjoy this novel without paying. But I'm not going to lie to you: I also would like to be able to get some money, or at least to be able to recover the invested one, clearly I´m not trying to get rich with this project, only to be able to recover some of the money spend. Some things, like the textures of the 3D models, the storage in the cloud to render the images remotely, or the translation of the texts (I am from Argentina and English is not my native language), have a cost, and from my heart I tell you that it is worth every penny spent on this novel, but of course, it wouldn´t be bad if I can recover some of the money spent hahaha. Just say goodbye to you with a big hug and thank you for being part of this project which is so important to me.

Each society's gradual expansion eventually led to an historic meeting in a backwater region of space known as the Spinward Marches.\n\nAlthough their human physical appearances were exactly alike, several fundamental differences existed between the two great powers. The Zhodani's political structure was strictly authoritarian, whereas the Imperium was governed by the rule of the Emperor, a classic aristocracy. As the Zhodani race evolved, the human brain's potential was explored and mastered until the use of powerful psionics was a way of life. Mind-reading, telekinesis, extrasensory perception and clairvoyance became common among the Zhodani. The Imperium disdainfully outlawed the use of any form of psionics, believing these strange powers to be an invasion of mental privacy. Also, because the Zhodani utilized their superior mental ability in everyday life, many Imperial traders and merchants grew suspicious of their motives and avoided negotiations with the Zhodani.\nThe Imperial race, lacking psionics, saw its development grow along creative, artistic and emotional paths. And as with any creative society, wondrous achievement and joy was often coupled with imperfections and greed. The Zhodani - viewing the Imperial race as dishonest, morally corrupt, weak and insecure - lived highly structured and unemotional lifestyles. With two powerful societies so clearly opposed in political and social beliefs, confrontation was inevitable.\n\nAs the Zhodani continued to expand into the Spinward Marches, many worlds were peacefully integrated into the Zhodani Consulate. However, several independent worlds resisted the Zhodani, believing that they would lose their freedom and be forced to live under restrictive rule. The Spinward Marches became an intergalactic 'hot spot' and the aggressive advances of the Zhodani led to the first of several conflicts known as the Frontier Wars,the first of which began in 589 - 89 years after the two great powers first established contact.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Empire Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vepjlv9wahp1op5tny5p.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":112351,"name":"Meme Barley-Break","summary":"Meme Barley-Break is simple puzzle game where you need to collect memes according to the rules of the Barley-Break.

As with other games of its kind, the idea is to prevent wave after wave of enemy troops to get to the player's command center. This is done by building stationary turrets that automatically shoot at the enemies that come within their range. At the start of the game the player has a small sum of cash that can be spent on different turrets such as chain guns, missiles and flame throwers. By destroying enemy troops and surviving waves the player gets more money that can be used for building new turrets or upgrade old turrets.\n\nThe game consists of four different scenarios (beach, snow, platform and lava) each with three levels. A level consists of 20 or more enemy waves and once completed the next is unlocked. While the first scenario (beach) is straightforward tower defending the later scenarios adds additional level features that lead to further tactical considerations for the player.

Some sections contain 'Boss fights', where the player fights a boss from the Metal Gear Solid 4 storyline; e.g. Laughing Octopus. At the end of each mission, the player is awarded a rank based on their precision and speed in completing the mission.

You'll earn some gems that you can use to unlock new cards, but it's back to the drawing board after that. Start out with a new adventurer and set out on your quest once again.\n\nThe good news is that Meteorfall is different every time you play - you'll encounter different locations, different enemies, and different quests.

Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\n\nDan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan's health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player fills it with enough souls from defeated enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a legendary hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the game's true ending is revealed.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"developers":["SCE Cambridge Studio"],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":907891200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1tjk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":213825,"name":"Metroid: Spooky Mission","summary":"Imago is at it again!

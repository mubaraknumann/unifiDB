At night, armed with nothing but a flashlight, the trio of heroines enters the dark school building, prepared to explore every corner, and investigate every urban legend they have heard of...\n\nTansaku-hen opens the Twilight Syndrome horror adventure series, defining its stylistic traits and gameplay. The game is divided into chapters, each dedicated to a particular \"ghostly\" story. Unlike most Japanese-style adventures, there is physical character navigation in the game; the player moves digitized images of the three girls on 2D backgrounds, in a manner somewhat similar to side-scrolling games - though many areas feature a third dimension, like in Western third-person perspective adventures.\n\nThe gameplay consists of two activities only: walking and occasionally choosing a dialogue option and/or action, as prompted by the game's narrative. There is no other kind of interaction, no inventory, and no combat. Different choices may lead to different endings; the next chapter can be accessed only if the player has not attained the \"bad\" ending.\n\nTwilight Syndrome: Tansaku-hen abandons the nearly omnipresent anime/manga graphical style of Japanese games in favor of digitized images and photos of real people.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Human Entertainment"],"publishers":["Human Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":825638400,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2wb3.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":279095,"name":"Twilight Story: A Quiet House","summary":"Twilight Story a Quiet House is short first person psicological horror game when you play a role of sherif who come to town to investigate a missing girl.

When Aziraal's tomb was opened at the end of the first game, the god's powers transferred to our hero's sister. Now the dark lord Gandohar, determined to have Aziraal's power for himself, has taken our hero and his sister captive and is draining those powers from her. The escape from the prison acts as a tutorial for the game until the hero finally steps out into Antaloor.\n\nThere is a huge world to be explored containing deserts, forests, swamps, seashores, cities and rural areas, plus many hidden caves and dungeons. There will be encounters with every kind of monster imaginable from killer insects to huge beasts, as well as humanoid enemies of varied races. Since the levels of the enemies are not tied to the player's level, some fights need to be avoided until the hero advances and increases his abilities. The game boasts that there are enough quests to keep players busy for about 100 hours.\n\nIn the single-player game, the hero can be a male only. His specialty (warrior, ranger, mage) can be changed at will by swapping equipment. Success as each is entirely dependent upon how earned skill points are assigned.\n\nTwo Worlds II features improvements over the first game including new user interface, game engine and magic & crafting systems. It includes all of the gameplay elements that were part of Two Worlds I (riding on horseback, crafting, forging, alchemy). Sailing (planned for the first game, but never released) is possible in this game, albeit in only a few locations.\n\nFeats and skills can be learned to enhance each form of combat. Learned spells can be combined with each other using the new card modifiers to enhance or change their effects. Improvements to the crafting/forging aspects make it possible to improve weapons and armor differently. For instance, objects in inventory can be broken down to their base elements (cloth, wood, iron).\n\nTwo Worlds II also offers five multiplayer modes for up to 8 players: Crystal Capture, PvP, Dual, Adventure (7 chapters), and a Village mode. In multiplayer, new characters are created with a choice of several races and can be male or female.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Reality Pump"],"publishers":["TopWare Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":68.66666666666667,"release_date":1289520000,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21m8.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"27218","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-27218/"}]},{"igdb_id":77259,"name":"TwinStick: This Ain't No Picnic","summary":"Touted as a \"true twin stick\" shooter, TwinStick: This Ain't No Picnic puts players in control of two characters simultaneously.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vsux59ek7igkdszp5k4g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":188020,"name":"Two & One Hundred Ways Bundle","summary":"The \"Two & One Hundred Ways Bundle\" offers you more than 300 level of puzzle fun.\nTwo Hundred Ways gives puzzle fans twice as many mental challenges to overcome.

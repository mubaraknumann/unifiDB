[{"igdb_id":308078,"name":"OK! Puzzle Stars","summary":"Inspired by the British celebrity magazine franchise 'OK!', 'OK! Puzzle Stars' puts the player as the role of an Editor in Chief, who must solve a variety of puzzles in order to send 12 OK! magazines to the shops.\n\nThe game mainly utilises the Nintendo DS stylus for gameplay and includes puzzles like Wordsearches, Crosswords, Sudoku, Fitword and so on. The player is required to hold the Nintendo DS console sideways in order to play the game. The Start button is also used to pause a puzzle at any time and brings up the Pause Menu (which includes options to continue the puzzle, teach handwriting recognition to suit the player's handwriting mode, or to quit the puzzle).\n\nEvery issue in the game includes 16 puzzles to solve and for every 4 solved, the player must then solve a special puzzle called a 'Puzzle Star' (which rewards the player a cover item for the current issue). When all 4 cover item elements are achieved for one issue, the player moves onto the next until all 12 are complete.\n\nFor every puzzle complete, the player is awarded an OK! Scratch Card. Here players must use the Nintendo DS stylus to rub one out of 3 stars shown to win a certain number of Stars (which allow players to purchase hints in a difficult situation).\n\nThe game includes a variety of famous celebrity photographs throughout Bonus Puzzles (as well as the issue covers) and displays fascinating celebrity facts during the saving processes.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Team 3 Games"],"publishers":["Ubisoft Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1272585600,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8kd8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":69375,"name":"Okinawa Rush","summary":"Okinawa Rush is a martial arts platforming game with RPG elements, many items to collect and unique FengShui system.","genres":["Fighting","Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Sokaikan"],"publishers":["No Gravity Games","PixelHeart"],"aggregated_rating":80.0,"release_date":1616716800,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch","Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2lc0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":338923,"name":"Okko the Exiled","summary":"Okko The Exiled is an action-packed adventure, where you stomp, launch, and bash your way through Kutala, a land of demons, on a quest to defeat the demon lord Yalda and link Okko’s isolated world with the heavens.","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Frozen Flame Interactive"],"publishers":["Eastasiasoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1798675200,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Mac","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9myf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":8962,"name":"Oknytt","summary":"Oknytt is a point-and-click adventure game where the player takes the role of a small, seemingly insignificant creature, leading it through a dark world filled with beings and areas inspired by Swedish folklore, to help it find a place to belong.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Nemoria Entertainment"],"publishers":["Nemoria Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1373241600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2h9j.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":339603,"name":"Okey.gg","summary":"Turkish traditional games Okey and 101, are finally on Steam.

OKAGE: Shadow King is not a holiday story, however, but a dark tale of polar opposites that questions basic notions of identity and essence.\n\nPlayers take the role of Ari, a young man with a remarkable affliction. A powerful demon -- calling himself \"Stan\" -- has taken refuge in Ari's shadow and is becoming infused in the boy's life. To free both his demon and himself, Ari embarks on a dangerous and involved quest to rid the world of seven other rival demons. Though he suffers under the burden of playing host to Stan, Ari is also aided from time to time by his demon's powers and the two begin to forge a symbiotic relationship.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Zener Works Inc."],"publishers":["Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":984614400,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1oy0.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":282873,"name":"O.K.

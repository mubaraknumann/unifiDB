Some cards can also be upgraded, permanently lowering their deployment cost—offering long-term depth over short-term optimization.\n\nWith each level-up, you gain a skill point to invest in passive bonuses—such as higher starting resources, larger hand size, or better resource rates. This adds a growing meta-progression system that deepens your playstyle alongside your deck choices.\n\nExperienced players can take on missions, randomly generated mini-campaigns with special challenges. Completing them earns mission coins used to unlock special booster packs.

The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as \"Durandal\". Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz's gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity... \n \nFront Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation: Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Tactical"],"developers":["Square Enix Product Development Division 6"],"publishers":["Square Enix"],"aggregated_rating":73.0,"release_date":1071705600,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ove.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"711","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Front Mission 4"},{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"771","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-771/"}]},{"igdb_id":340259,"name":"Frightening Monastery","summary":"After receiving a mysterious invitation to a summer camp, you are captured by Sister Madeline inside Eagle's Junior High School.

Unfortunately this house is infested with mice which roam the screen, gnawing through pipes and generally causing problems for our man Tom. Once a mouse gnaws through a pipe, you'll see the flow of water stop and a pipe piece will fall to the ground. To repair the pipe Tom must pick up the fallen piece (you can hold two pieces a time), and put it back into the hole. To get to where the holes are, Tom must carefully climb up and navigate the maze of pipes. Although Tom can cross short gaps in the pipes, he'll need to go around the larger ones. While climbing around on the pipes, Tom will run across several different kinds of mice. Each mouse has its own color and purpose. When the flow of water is interrupted, the timer in the reservoir will begin to count downward from 5000 at the rate of 100 points per second. The only way to stop this countdown is to restore the water flow by fixing the pipes. If the timer reaches zero, Tom will lose a life and play the current level over again.

This is an official version of Frostpunk, one of the most popular PC hits in recent history, now made available on smartphones.\n\nIn Frostpunk: Beyond the Ice, a post-apocalyptic scenario awaits, although it's unlike any other: a modern ice age has left your city totally isolated from everything around it. Your city is humanity's last stronghold, and it's your job to help as many people as possible survive while making morally difficult decisions as you fight to get through another day.\n\nGameplay in this survival game is based on constructing buildings, gathering resources, and making tough decisions. Not only do you have to choose which buildings to construct but also how many workers are assigned to each one. As is typical in a strategic management game, you'll have to wait between each construction project or resource harvest until it's done.\n\nDeciding your city's laws, on the other hand, is one of the most interesting and unique aspects of this game. The rules you set might seem extreme compared to today's laws, but this game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, so you'll have to do everything you can to ensure your survival. Both the decision- and law-making processes are practically identical to the original version of the game, which feels like a fresh take for this genre.\n\nFrostpunk: Beyond the Ice is an excellent survival game with a good dose of strategy. To play it well, you'll need to think carefully before making important decisions in this icy world. This game stands out for its infinite possibilities as well as its difficulty. While your city might not survive on your first attempt, you'll get better at living in the deadly world of Frostpunk each time you play.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["Com2uS"],"publishers":["Com2uS"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1730160000,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7oep.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":114642,"name":"Friendbase","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["Friendbase"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":266994,"name":"Frieseria: The Grand Reopening","summary":"WE ARE OPEN!

In addition to riding across real-world locales, players can participate in side events like bus jumping, wheelies, and zipping through tunnels of fire to earn some notoriety and cash for their character. Money can then be used to purchase new equipment including bikes, clothing, accessories, and more.\n\nNine professional riders are available to play as or against, including such legends as Kris \"The Rock\" Rourke and Ronnie \"Kung Fu\" Faisst. Seven generic riders are also selectable, bringing the total lineup of characters to 16. Players must guide these characters through various skill-based challenges in order to unlock the remaining courses. Once unlocked, the eight levels seamlessly connect with one another to form one sprawling environment. Within each region are special events entitled Big Air, Freestyle, Hill Climb, and Race, which typically involve performing as many aerial stunts as possible to outscore the competition.\n\nFreestyle MetalX also features a number of sub-games to add some diversity to the racing action. Players will ride off a cliff to see how many tricks they can perform during their rapid decent, become a human dart while hurling themselves toward an enormous dartboard, and even participate in a game of motocross pinball. Those tired of the existing courses can create their own arena using the built-in level editor. No matter which mode is selected, players can listen to hard-driving music from such bands as Megadeath, Mötley Crüe, Motörhead, and Twisted Sister.","genres":["Racing","Sport"],"developers":["Deibus Studios"],"publishers":["Midway Games"],"aggregated_rating":60.0,"release_date":1056672000,"platforms":["Xbox","Nintendo GameCube","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2nxd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"2054","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-2054/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"1877","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Freestyle%20MetalX"}]},{"igdb_id":147675,"name":"From Shadows","summary":"From Shadows is an action game blending the style of fast-paced platformers and beat’em ups.

Even though it is directly connected to the more serious Xak storyline, Fray has a less serious tone and light-hearted comedic approach to telling the story. It was originally released for the MSX2 and was later ported to several different systems, among them MSX turbo R, PC-9801, PC Engine (as Fray CD), and Game Gear.\nFray is a simple action RPG. The game proceeds by the player's character Fray fighting through a preset overhead view map shooting opposing monsters, jumping over obstacles, and locating powerups and Gold, the game's currency, along the way. At the end of each stage the player will fight a boss and enter a town or safe haven where the player can purchase new equipment, hit points and the option to save their progress.

A handful of colonists struck out on their own to begin anew - far away from the Earth and its turmoil. Several ships were launched with enough equipment and supplies to give the hundreds onboard a fighting chance - but since the area around far-off Sirius had never been surveyed, no one really knew what to expect. What they found was a new frontier of free-flowing natural resources, unexplored territories, great wonders and lurking dangers. Each ship, representing the clusters of people and their earthly place of origin, settled into different parts of the galaxy pre-selected by their ship-board computer to give them the best chance of survival.\n\nLife was hard in the beginning, but over the 800 years the different colonies prospered and expanded their territories, claiming more and more systems for their own. Survival and propagation eventually led to growth and profit as each of the colonies developed specialties and fostered commerce. As the colonies grew and time passed their connections with their roots on Earth dwindled and they lost their memories of the conflicts of the past. Soon their attention was dominated by new, more immediate conflicts. Feelings of lost ancestral connection spurred anachronism in the look of the great cities, and created a somewhat distorted image of each colony's cultural heritage. In the ever-expanding outer edge of the territories, frontier lawlessness prevailed.\n\nThe Houses: Each shipboard colony that left Earth carried some memory of its origins in its name. The Liberty carried Americans, The Bretonia flew from The United Kingdom and surrounding territory, The Kusari from Asia, and the Rheinland launched with Germanic cargo.\n\nAs each ship settled and colonies began to expand, they knew little about each other and their advancing development. Finally, little by little, the individual colonies found each other and began to set up trade routes to link their systems for commerce and solidarity.\n\nToday, with each colony firmly rooted in its respective corner of the galaxy, the colonies rely heavily on each other for trade and industry but also compete for resources and new territories in the Border Worlds. The colonies mandate member governments in \"The New Alliance\" within the Sirius sector. To control conflicts, each colony has forged alliances and treaties with others as they have grown. Competition remains fierce, however. Struggles rage for supremacy in business, commerce, resources, power and control. There can be tenuous peace between colonies' political agendas, but the grabs for holdings constantly unsettle the volatile frontier.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":["Digital Anvil"],"publishers":["Microsoft Game Studios"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1046736000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ibd.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"5105","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Freelancer"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"5565","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-5565/"}]},{"igdb_id":283575,"name":"Frostrain","summary":"Be the last train conductor roaming the postapocalyptic frozen world!

Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a stage, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a stage, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.\n\nMoney and experience are earned through the completion of mission objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers. Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase its jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer.","genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":["Omiya Soft","Solid"],"publishers":["Square","Square Enix"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":825033600,"platforms":["Wii","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2k5g.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"6644","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Front%20Mission:%20Gun%20Hazard"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"7265","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-7265/"}]},{"igdb_id":270407,"name":"Frog Feast","summary":"A port of Frog Feast for the Uzebox.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Lee Weber"],"publishers":["Belogic"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1423958400,"platforms":["Uzebox"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9spw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":11483,"name":"Frogger 2","summary":"A puzzle game with cute graphics for the Atari ST.

The video game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up their wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. Missions in Front Mission 2089 are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets to protecting a particular allied target. Due to its mobile phone format, the story of Front Mission 2089 is told through episodic content; new episodes were released for download on the video game's official website on a bi-weekly basis. A returning feature in the game is the Arena. Like in Front Mission, players can fight other players to win monetary rewards. Mission rankings also make a return; based on the scoring system of Front Mission 3, players can earn new parts and wanzers by doing well during missions. Another returning feature is briefings.

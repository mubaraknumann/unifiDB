Surviving humans found a shelter on a planet called Jorune. A civil war errupted, humans fighting the indigenous population; eventually, peace was achieved, and the various races found a way to co-exist with each other... all except one. The Shantha, one of the most ancient and powerful races on Jorune, adepts at the magical art of Isho, were not satisfied with the shape the planet has taken. 3500 years later, one of them, known as the Red Shantha, began attacking human settlements. The hero of the game is one of the villagers who have survived Red Shantha's attack. Having found the way to master Isho, the hero must rescue his friends and explore the planet, searching for the source of evil.\n\nAlien Logic is based on the Skyrealms of Jorune role-playing system. The player takes control of one character; there is no party in the game. While there is a story to follow, much of the game is open-ended, dedicated to exploring Jorune, searching for items, precious crystals (which increase the hero's parameters), and fighting enemies. The exploration mode uses a side-scrolling perspective; the player can switch to combat mode when an enemy is nearby. Combat takes place on the same screen as exploration, and is action-based. Combat relies heavily on magic (Isho); casting spells deplete the Isho bar. Spell sequences are called dyshas, which can be offensive or defensive. Preparing dysha combinations beforehand and then using them on the enemies (by clicking on them) is an essential combat strategy.","genres":["Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Ceridus Software"],"publishers":["SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":788832000,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9qjh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":375776,"name":"All My Heart, Banjo","summary":"A click & point + mini-games adventure where you'll be able to partake in various activities and dialogue to discover our main character and his backstory.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1760572800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coarxx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":12492,"name":"Alien Crush","summary":"Fight against the aliens with your pinball skills!\n\nImagine a living pinball machine...with aliens and outlandish worlds to throw at you.

Though after seemingly being lost to the inhabitants of the world, energi once again makes its appearance, and before long begins to drive opposing powers into an all out scramble to take control of this ever diminishing resource.\n\nEnergi… the source of power interconnected with all living things.\n\nIn times of old, the human race erected a great civilization that thrived on the use of this power. However, some two centuries earlier, an incident known as the Energi Crisis erupted and led to the planet's energi being sealed away. As a result, people lost the mysterious powers they were once capable of harnessing.\n\nThe story now picks up with the protagonist, Leon, who has been assigned to his first solo mission by the Energi Guild. And there within his mind echo the words of the guildmistress when she stated: \"Energi is the hidden power within each individual. It is the power of the heart and mind, and when purposefully sought, its true potential is unleashed.\"\n\nNostalgia at its best! It’s like old-school meets new-school with perfect harmony!\nSporting a colorful and gorgeously detailed 2D battle system, individual break skills, elementals that combine to create more powerful energi skills, and even an auto-battle function, Alphadia II comes equipped with everything fans of traditional JRPGs could expect and caters to both the hardcore and casual gamer alike!\n\nEnergi is the key!\nEnergi is derived from one of six unique elementals and has the power to not only grow, but lead players to the acquisition of new and more powerful energi skills. These energi skills then, in turn, play an integral role in attack, recovery, and even support. Furthermore, once two separate elementals have reached a certain level, they can be combined to create even more powerful energi skills!\n\nCan you handle it?!\nAside from a voluminous story, Alphadia II offers a new \"Mission\" system in which players are able to accept missions from the guild in order to receive valuable coins. These coins can then be exchanged for powerful equipment and other hard-to-get items later on.

The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.\n\nAll of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.\n\nWhen dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.\n\nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.\n\nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.","genres":["Shooter","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":["Team Shinobi"],"publishers":["Sega of America","Tec Toy","U.S. Gold","Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","Sega Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation 3","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Linux","Wii","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","Atari ST/STE","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Amiga","Xbox 360","Amstrad CPC","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2er6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":113623,"name":"Alvastia Chronicles","summary":"RPG with over 100 companions?!

To that end, the fact remains the same: all zombies must die.\n\nAs well infesting familiar locations such as Town Square, Shopping Mall and Surburbia, the undead have ambled their way into all new areas of Deadhill: the Military Base and Graveyard. McJagger will also have to deal with three new flavours of zombie: Soldier, Necro and Ghost. Our stoic hero shouldn’t be too concerned, however, there are two new weapons to help send the shufflers packing: Mini-gun and Rocket Launcher. Boom!\n\nYour score is based on a combination of two multipliers, one of which increases as you complete quests that appear organically as you play, and the other based on how many environmental modifiers you’ve managed to apply to the undead.

One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.\n\nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.\n\nThe Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Right Stuff"],"publishers":["Sand Storm","Right Stuff"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":738547200,"platforms":["TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","FM Towns","Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD","Sega CD"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4mkk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":188569,"name":"Alik: Gry i zabawy","summary":"Set of didactic games with the friendly dog Alik, which will surely conquer the hearts of all children and become their friend, helper and guide.

The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area.

Once at the counter, the player will have to look at things like:\n1. The demand for the goods in which he sells.\n2. Events in the world: crop failure, holidays, diseases and many others, dictating which types of goods will be sold and which ones will not.\n3. Daily decrees. Against the background of a heated political situation, or as part of the fight against the deficit, there may be bans on trade in certain goods, or with certain categories of customers. You can also stumble upon a decree prohibiting overcharging prices above a certain limit.\n4. The total cost of goods on the market. Yes. The player’s warehouse is limited and its resources are spent as they are sold. For a successful game, you will have to enter into contracts of varying degrees of profitability, or even go to the black market and buy products “from the hands”.\n5. Since one category of goods in different countries is cheaper than in another, it makes sense to buy your own caravan and transport them between countries.\n6. So, as a player can not be immediately and everywhere, as his license level grows, he can buy himself an additional shop and put the hired manager in it. Each manager has his own set of characteristics and asks for a percentage of income, and also has an invisible scale of hidden perks, which can be a surprise at any successful, or vice versa - an uncomfortable moment.\n7. The world lives its own life - wars, politics, disasters and other events affect trade, forcing them to adapt and not allow them to rest on their laurels.\n8. Paying a lot of attention to one country and building relationships with them can lose respect for another, which will necessarily affect income, as well as, it is quite possible for the integrity of the player’s shops, and even the health and life of the manager sitting in it.\n9. Countries have their own, unique features, where in Amandgerat a player will receive a penalty for trading prohibited goods, in Wildland he simply risks losing everything at once, or he can raise as much in a trade as his character is not possible in his native country.\n10. Also, trade is complicated by taxation and the need to pay for each new license, the possibility of losing goods in a warehouse during a state audit, or simply due to the fact that the newly hired employee turned out to be an accomplice to thieves.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1542672000,"platforms":["Android"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jcw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":30596,"name":"Alpine Ski VR","summary":"Alpine Ski VR by Suchworks Studios brings the thrill of skiing to your desktop.

You're drawn to this world by forces unknown, and tasked with the purpose of delivering it from the grips of a terrible evil... whether or not you do so, or join it, is up to you.\n\nYour choices make a difference in Aleph. The party you recruit, the mercenaries you hire, the items you acquire, the dungeons you visit, the objects you craft... all of it will influence how you ultimately play the game. But more importantly, the moral choices you make will greatly affect numerous outcomes throughout the game. Commit murder in town, you will be attacked by the guards. Steal too much? You can be thrown in a dungeon.\n\nMore importantly though, the great evil that threatens the world upon its waking state is directly influenced by the moral choices you make throughout your journey. The more you adhere to the Principles of the Aleph and make good moral choices, the easier the fight against the great evil will be. Should you make numerous nefarious choices, you may not be able to defeat the evil, though you may join it...\n\nChallenge comes to you not just in the form of combat against a huge multitude of enemies and boss encounters, but also in the form of numerous puzzles and riddles to solve, artifacts to find, and a huge world to explore.\n\nIndeed, the world of Aleph is very large, and it is also open. You are free to visit whichever towns, whichever dungeons whenever you please. A boat is required to sail to some of the locations.\n\nThis might sound daunting, and perhaps it is, but you are not alone and unprepared. Many allies await you throughout the world of Aleph, happy to join your party. Each ally brings several unique skills to the group, so it is up to you to make the tactical choices - do you bring with you a healer? A potent mage? A stalwart knight to tank damage? How about a girl that transforms into a golem? Beyond the help in the form of friends, you are bestowed with one of the titular Alephs, a small round gem that allows you to locate objects, people, and locations.\n\nAleph also comes with a Seer's Companion Tome, a separate PDF that will provide useful and insightful information for numerous aspects of the game world.\n\nIf you are looking for a challenging RPG with an epic amount of content, this is the RPG for you.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure"],"developers":["PVGames"],"publishers":["PVGames"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1554940800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":207804,"name":"Alice in Wonderland: Jigsaw Puzzle","summary":"Relive Alice's adventures in Wonderland with this beautifully illustrated jigsaw puzzle game.

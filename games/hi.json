As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n\nHitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["IO Interactive"],"publishers":["Square Enix","IO Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":78.58974358974359,"release_date":1457654400,"platforms":["Google Stadia","PlayStation 4","Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fgr.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":336786,"name":"Hitman 3: The Drop Pack","summary":"Unlock a series of cosmetics inspired by The Drop Elusive Target mission and gain permanent access to The Base - A two-level Arcade contract featuring The Drop Elusive Target.","genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"developers":["IO Interactive"],"publishers":["IO Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1726099200,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa6f8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":164091,"name":"H-Isekai Loves","summary":"What will you do when you are accidentally transported to another world?

At a young age, he lost an arm and eye, and was soon ridiculed by his peers for it. Eventually, it proved to be too much, and Gaou became a thief. In spite of his corrupt lifestyle, however, he was able to settle down with a wife - for a while, at least. It all came crashing to a halt over one little disagreement, as Gaou cussed her out... and then killed her!\n\nFilled with remorse, Gaou chose to repent his wicked deeds, and turned to a Buddhist monk for help. The monk's teachings eventually led him to pursue his passion for sculpting, which led to a series of powerful works renowned for the raw emotions pent up inside him that were expressed therein. But it wasn't enough - Gaou needed to be completely reborn! Hearing about the mystical phoenix, who grants those who drink its blood eternal life, from a fellow sculptor named Akanemaru, Gaou set out on a journey to find the great bird of fire... and hopefully to be reincarnated...\n\nBased on the \"Hō-ō\" (or \"Karma\" volume) of Osamu Tezuka's famous manga Hinotori (or \"Phoenix\"), \"Hinotori\" is a vertically-scrolling shooting game where Gaou's goal is to locate the mystical phoenix across 6 stages of labyrinths, enemies and various other obstacles. As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots.

The ability to take POWs, added enhanced stealth options for the player which include the acquisition of enemy uniforms. Mission types include, espionage, sabotage, search and destroy, town liberation, prisoner rescue, retrieval of enemy officers and documents, partisan assistance and assassination. The variety of locales include Norway, Libya, a Norwegian fjord, Burma, Austria, France and Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe expansion pack Sabre Squadron adds missions in France, Libya and Sicily. Some of the missions are modeled on real SAS exploits. However most of the game takes liberty with the historical time and place of SAS operations.[6] The missions are based on sandbox style game-play where players are free to roam a map and pursue objectives usually at their leisure and choice of sequence. A real time strategy mechanic also allows players to control events for staged sequential tactical maneuvers or through real time overhead command.","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Tactical"],"developers":["Illusion Softworks"],"publishers":["Take-Two Interactive","Gathering of Developers","Global Star Software"],"aggregated_rating":86.0,"release_date":1066694400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1q6k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"17261","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hidden & Dangerous 2"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"18842","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18842/"}]},{"igdb_id":248116,"name":"Hidden Epee","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":["G5"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6fxz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":135652,"name":"Him & Her","summary":"Defy gravity to find love amidst darkness in this challenging Puzzle-Platformer. \nHim & Her is a challenging Puzzle-Platformer in which the player must find a path to their significant other by defying gravity. \n \nCan you find love amidst darkness?","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":["Game Nacional"],"publishers":["QUByte Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1591833600,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ccz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":21907,"name":"Hieroglyphika","summary":"Open the gate to the egyptian underworld!

The game is similar to other robot/mech games by Masaya/NSC, such as Vixen 357 on Sega Mega Drive.At the end of the 24th century, humanity recovered from a devastative World War and humans started to colonize the galaxy. In 2384, unknown invaders attack the Jupiter base and finally reach Earth. Although the Earth Federation has prepared a counter offensive, the chances of success are very slim. But the Asian Federation has a secret weapon, the SERD Squadron, and its mission is to find and destroy the invader’s bases and drive them out of Earth. Hiso Kihei Serd is a turn based war game at its core and in any given mission the player must deploy and control a number of Serd giant robots on an overhead map – each mech comes with its own characteristics, some are fast and have long-range attacks whereas others are bulkier, slower but use more powerful weaponry. When a fight between two opponents is triggered, the screen switches to an animated sequence. Each Serd gains experience in battle which may be used to enhance its attack and evasive capabilities. However, should one of the Serd be destroyed during a given mission, it is gone for good but more (up to seven) can be acquired as the game progresses. Hiso Kihei Serd consists of ten missions and is single player only. A password system also allows the player to save his progress (although the backup RAM can also be used).\n\nIt is important to remember that some units possess a special ability, many of which can easily turn the tide of the battle. Using them wisely is a key to quick victory in later stages. Overall, this is an enjoyable game, and a prequel to Vixen 357. One can easily notice the similarities between these 2 games, and it’s easy to pick up one if you’ve ever played the other one at some point.","genres":["Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["NCS"],"publishers":["NCS"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":635731200,"platforms":["TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6xfj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":58316,"name":"Hissatsu Pachinko Station 3","summary":"An entry (technically the fourth) in SunSoft's long-running \"Hissatsu\" pachinko series.","genres":["Quiz/Trivia"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p2kxpttjxan1pl835kwi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":172370,"name":"HighQ Quiz","summary":"A simple quiz game with multiple ways to play.

But so did crime. Huge corporations, which were in fact criminal organizations, came to control the world. Finally, a mega-corporation known as Connection has taken the power in its hands. Everything was sponsored with its money; the governments and the law were silent. Only vigilante groups called \"Connection-Killers\" still tried to resist. In 2015, in Detroit, one of those people, nicknamed DD, witnessed the death of his comrades...\n\nA year has passed. DD moves to Brain City - a highly developed, modern city, the center of scientific research. It was built on an island in the Atlantic Ocean, which appeared after a volcano eruption. It is controlled by Connection. DD opens an investigation office in the city, trying to get to the heart of Connection and defeat his old nemesis, despite the hostile atmosphere and the grave dangers that await him there...\n\nHis Name is Diamond is a RPG with top-down navigation and first-person turn-based combat. The player controls DD as he moves through the urban environments of the game. The enemies appear randomly and are mostly grotesquely exaggerated everyday people (workers, journalists, etc.), with a large amount of sexy women. DD deals with the enemies through various menu commands. Instead of a simple \"attack\" option, there are various techniques and extensive item usage, so that many of the fights feel almost like mini-puzzles. DD gains experience and levels up, increasing his parameters, after defeating enemies.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Visual Novel"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":855878400,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5w4v.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":324242,"name":"Hidden Winter Things","summary":"Enter a winter fairy tale with cat people, elves and cute atmosphere.

It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\".\n\nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.\n\nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.","genres":["Adventure","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":545356800,"platforms":["Family Computer","MSX2","Nintendo Entertainment System","Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5ttv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":267337,"name":"Hidden Object: Victoria & Steve Vikings Adventures","summary":"Do you have a fur-coat?

A key strategic element to the game is for the player character to travel several screens ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path for it; normally this would be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion. However, if the bomb is left in an unsafe location, it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once.

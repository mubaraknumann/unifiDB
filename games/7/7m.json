Thousand years ago, seven legendary heroes have sealed the powers of evil with seven sacred stones. But now, the stones have been weakened, and the ancient evil raises its head again. Monsters attack villages and towns. It is your task to retrieve the seven stones and to restore peace in the land.\n\nIn this strategy RPG, the emphasis is on preparation for the battles rather than on the battles themselves. Before each battle, you are able to see the stats of the monsters and even the tactics they are going to use. You must then select seven units of various classes (knights, archers, mages, etc.) and place them on a battle field, which is a grid composed of four columns and three rows. Front row can attack, middle row support or attack with bows, and back row heals. The battle itself is controlled by computer AI, but you can change formation at any time.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":["Namco Limited"],"publishers":["Namco Limited"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":977356800,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zkr.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":14,"store":"playstation","uid":"16948","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Seven%3A%20Molmorth%20no%20Kiheitai"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"18498","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18498/"}]},{"igdb_id":111509,"name":"7-minute HOP","summary":"Let's help this cute alien to get as high as possible!

I've gotten some requests about releasing it as a modpack so here it is.\n\nRLCraft, the RL standing for Real Life or Realism and is a take on another mod I made for Unreal called RLCoop that generally has a similar goal, is my interpretation of what I've always wanted in Minecraft when it comes to pure survival, adventuring and RPG, and immersion. I hand selected many mods and individually tweaked each and every one to fit the exact play-style I was looking for, making sure they all worked fluidly with each other, adding my own custom scripts for various changes to vanilla behavior, etc.\n\nBottom line is, this ain't your dad's Minecraft, and you're going to die...a lot. Just be prepared for that. This tends to happen whenever I make mods for any game for some reason...it usually ends up being unfairly difficult.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1640044800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4tn4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":333189,"name":"RLChess","summary":"Dive into the ultimate chess showdown with RLChess!

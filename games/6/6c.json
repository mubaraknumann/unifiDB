[{"igdb_id":93366,"name":"6 Colors","summary":"6 Colors is a freeware version of 7 Colours. Two opponents (one of them can be an AI) start from opposite corners of the gameboard, which is covered by randomly colored tiles. The aim is to expand across the board annexing tiles to your domain. The one who gets more than 50% of the gameboard area wins.\n\nEach move involves selecting one of the six colors, which will annex any tiles of that colour which are adjacent to one of your tiles, and temporarily turn your whole domain to that color. It is not possible to select the color your opponent has just played, to prevent attempting to annex his tiles - however this color will always be available in your next move.\n\nThe game allows square, hexagonal, and random-shape tiles. To ensure that the game is fair, one can flip the gameboard and play again from another side.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1120521600,"platforms":["Windows Mobile","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]}]

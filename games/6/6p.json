[{"igdb_id":86067,"name":"6-Pak","summary":"6-Pak is a compilation of Sega Mega Drive games released in June 1995, during the console's decline. The cartridge contains 6 of Sega's most successful games from the early days of the system; Sonic the Hedgehog, Golden Axe, Revenge of Shinobi, Streets of Rage, Columns and Super Hang-On. The in-game menu features digitized box art of the original games. It also came with a 67-page manual that contained the complete instructions for all six games. Interestingly, the artwork used on the box for Columns is not from the Mega Drive version, but instead the Sega Master System edition of the game.","genres":["Platform","Racing","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Sega Entertainment","Tec Toy"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":820368000,"platforms":["Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1xxl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":132362,"name":"6 People","summary":"A man travels in a subway car alone.

Most of the systems you would expect such as sonar and periscope are featured and nicely presented in VGA. The game offers ten missions for both the Soviet and American side in a Cold War scenario, that grows progressively hotter. Nice to see that the two sides' submarines have their own graphic sets in the game, even with some pseudo-cyrillic labels on the Russian side.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Electronic Arts","Electronic Arts"],"publishers":["Electronic Arts","Sega Enterprises, Ltd."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co211k.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3480","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-3480/"},{"category":null,"store":"store_None","uid":"3190","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/688%20Attack%20Sub"}]},{"igdb_id":357085,"name":"687 Days on Mars","summary":"687 Days on Mars is a survival game where you are stranded alone on Mars - your task is to manage resources, build a base from scratch, grow food, and explore the red planet in search of supplies and other hidden challenges.

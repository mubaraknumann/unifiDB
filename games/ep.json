It is a 3D city building game in which you need to nurture and protect the woodland home of the Jinn.\n\nIs it just Ice Age Village in the forest?\nThe gameplay in Epic is very similar to other city building games such as The Simpsons: Tapped Out and Gameloft's own Ice Age Village. You have to build your very own version of the Jinn kingdom by planting special trees, constructing lodges and building training grounds and academies for your woodland villagers.\n\nThe idea of Epic is that you plant seed-producing flowers, then you transform the seeds into nectar by planting nectar springs. Seeds and nectar can be used as game currency to purchase new objects for your woodland village.\n\nEverything you plant or construct in Epic takes some time to build, though you can avoid waiting around by spending Aura, which you acquire or can purchase in-app. It's feasible that you can build up your village without spending real money, but eventually that requires lots of waiting.\n\nThere's also a military angle to Epic, which helps to add some variety to the gameplay and lift it above the ranks of the average city building game. You are responsible for an army of leafmen, who you must train up and equip with weapons and spells in order to fight the insurging Boggans.\n\nYou can take part in battles against the Boggans, which are represented through a different game screen. Here, you decide which leafmen you want to use to best crush your opponents in battles which mix skill and strategy. Epic includes a multiplayer battle mode, where you can go head-to-head with other players.\n\nAside from the battle element to the game, there are some nice touches to Epic, which help to add some variety and interest. For example, there's a theater you can build where you can watch video content based around the Epic movie.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Gameloft"],"publishers":["Gameloft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9rql.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":327930,"name":"Epyka","summary":"Epyka is an adventure, puzzle, narrative VR caper into the mysteries and blunder of a forgotten society.

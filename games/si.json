However, a few balls can't be picked up and the pattern needs to be remembered,\n\nDuring the last mini game the player gets presented with a panel of buttons. He bounces a ball on those buttons to recreate the pattern from before. He needs to look after a force field which follows the ball's movements - touching it results in losing a life. The buttons also flash in different colours and the bouncing only gets registered when the right colour is active. After finishing this level the game loops with faster enemies.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Durell Software"],"publishers":["Durell Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":532828800,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co47xs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":264865,"name":"Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution","summary":"Experience the journey of a civilization's birth to it's rise of power.

This newest game is challenging, exciting, and even infuriating, at times. Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.\n\nThe game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.\n\nSounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won’t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it’s game over, and you’ll have to start over again.\n\nChallenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately.

A crew member murders her shipmates, destroys the communication system and sets the ship on a collision course with the sun. The robots, being little more than automata, continue their everyday operations oblivious to the danger but the ship's computer, capable of thinking, awakens Kim Kimberley before the deranged crew member destroys it. She exits her modified stasis chamber with the goal of finding a way to reach the control room and avert disaster. \nDevelopment \n \nSnowball was originally released during 1983 as the company's fourth adventure game using the A-Code system.[1] Nick, Mike, and Pete Austin headed development. Though Level 9's previous games featured a fantasy theme, the Austin brothers chose a science fiction theme.[5] The original release used version 1 of this system[6] and was initially released only for the BBC Micro, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Nascom,[7] but was later followed by versions for the Commodore 64, Camputers Lynx, Oric-1, Atari 8-bit[8] as well as for the Memotech MTX, Amstrad CPC, Enterprise and MSX.[9] It is noteworthy for including over seven thousand locations. To achieve this sixty-eight hundred locations on the passenger disks form a colour-coded maze with minimal descriptions. \n \nAnother peculiar aspect of the game was the confusion behind the main character's gender. In an interview for Sinclair User, Chris Bourne asked, \"Is the androgynous Kim a man or woman?\" Pete Austin pointed out that \"there's a credit at the end for the design of 'Ms Kimberley's costume,' \" but also admitted that Kim Kimberley was \"a deliberately unisex name.\" The debate came to an end with the release of Return to Eden, where it was made more explicit that Kim was not a man, because the surviving crew members confuse her with the woman who tried to destroy the ship.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":233673,"name":"Silhouette","summary":"Silhouette is a cozy puzzle VR game that tasks the player with helping little shadow creatures (the Shadowies) through 28 puzzles.

The only evidence against her is the \"mempak\" from the control room, which shows her as the hijacker rather than the saviour. Despite the fact that the recording is damaged and thus is unreliable, they sentence her to death. About to be thrown into space, Kim manages to escape aboard a \"stratoglider\" and an hour later, lands on Eden. At this point the game starts. \n \nThe first thing the player must do is find a shelter for Kim, because a few moves into the game the Snowball 9 crew use the ship's engine to try to burn her down. The native robots take this as proof that the Snowball 9 is not the ship they were expecting but a hostile alien craft they must destroy. The objective is to contact the robots before time ends for the Snowball 9 and everyone aboard it. \n \nDevelopment \n \nUnlike its predecessor, Return to Eden only had about two hundred and fifty locations, but it was Level 9's first game to feature graphics.[5] Other adventure games had included graphics before, but version 2 of the A-Code system, allowed Level 9 to encode location graphics into as little as forty bytes. This size made it possible to add graphics to every location of the game for all formats with more than 32 K RAM. The user could choose not to display them and play the game in text-only mode. It was released for the same platforms as its predecessor. \n \nThe game's first cover depicted a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled a comic book character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration depicted another robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was not satisfied with the result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles. \n \nPete Austin commented on the game: \"It's an alien theme park gone wild.

SimSig brings the signal box to your home PC and with it the enjoyment and frustrations of running today's (and some of yesterday's) railways. How often has your train been delayed because of \"signal failure\" and you've wondered why trains can't be routed around the problem - or why it is even a problem in the first place? You'll soon see exactly why - with SimSig!\n\nSimSig is a simulation of a type of signal box used in the UK known as an Integrated Electronic Control Centre or IECC . First-hand railway experience along with the valuable input of others in the industry have helped to make this the most realistic signaling simulation available in the UK today. The ultimate test of this realism came when Railtrack trialed a version of SimSig for the Swindon B IECC. They were very happy with it, not having had a proper simulator for IECCs before which enabled them to assess and train signalers. While the Railtrack version of SimSig now has more features at their request, the underlying core and data are the same. Hence what you see is almost identical to what real signalers are being trained on and what they use every day!\n\nSimSig puts you in the seat of a signaler, also called a Dispatcher or Network Control Officer, operating signaling screens based on the widely used IECC and Westcad graphics used in the UK. That is, you operate the signals and points/switches in order to get trains to their destinations on time. SimSig has a wide range of areas you can operate including large portions of the UK, a small US simulation, and a couple of Australian areas. Each has its own challenges and skill level, the latter ranging from easy to mentally complicated.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1401753600,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8wh4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":358889,"name":"Silhouette of Fear","summary":"This game offers a collection of atmospheric and intense puzzles created for those who like to tickle their nerves.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1753142400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coa7rm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":342456,"name":"SiMarket Cloth Store Simulator","summary":"Build Miami’s hottest clothing store!

It was published in 2003. This expansion added eight new civilizations to the game, and including the eight civilizations from Play the World this brings the total number of playable civilizations up to thirty-one (the maximum supported by the game). The new civilizations are the Byzantines, the Dutch, the Hittites, the Incans, the Mayans, the Portuguese and the Sumerians. In addition to these playable civilizations, graphics for the Austrians are present in the editor so one can replace an existing civilization.\n\nTwo new special traits are added in this pack: seafaring and agricultural. Many of the new civilizations take advantage of these new traits (e.g. the Sumerians are Scientific and Agricultural), and some old civilizations are changed to more appropriate ones (e.g. the English have been changed from Expansionist and Commercial to Seafaring and Commercial).\n\nNew governments have also been added to the game, Feudalism and Fascism, and new Wonders of the World such as the Statue of Zeus and the Mausoleum of Mausollos. Four new bonus resources have been included, two of which provide food bonuses to previously unprofitable terrain. Oases can now be found in deserts, tropical fruit in jungles, sugar on plains and hills, and tobacco on grasslands and hills. In addition, two new types of terrain have been added. These are marshes and volcanoes. Players cannot construct cities on marshes, and cannot improve volcanoes in any way. Like jungles and flood plains, cities that have at least 1 citizen working a marsh may succumb to disease. Volcanoes may periodically erupt, destroying all improvements and cities and killing any units in some or all adjacent squares.\n\nThe centerpiece of this expansion pack, however, was the inclusion of scenarios, intended for multiplayer gaming. Unlike the main (\"epic\") game, these scenarios took much less time to play, and focused on a specific period in history.\n\nGenerally the reception of this expansion pack was much better than that of Play the World.\n\nOne year after Conquests was launched, the latest Civilization III stand-alone version, Civilization III: Complete was also released. This version included Civilization III, Play the World and Conquests. This version also includes several patches.\n\nTwo years later, in 2005 Civilization IV was released.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["BreakAway Games","Firaxis Games"],"publishers":["Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":1067904000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7ylx.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"3242","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-3242/"}]},{"igdb_id":344623,"name":"Sizzle & Stack","summary":"Sizzle & Stack is a fast-paced, card-based cooking simulator where deck-building meets restaurant chaos.

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.\n\nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity.

However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.\n\nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary.

It features cartoon characters and items instead of pseudo-realistic contraptions, but the goal is the same: to build hilarious machines reminiscent of the pictures of Rube Goldberg. \n \nSid Mouse and Al E. Cat have probably never heard of Tom & Jerry, but they’re just as single-minded: any means to hurt the adversary is a good one. They get plenty of means in Incredible Toons. Around 100 puzzles need to be solved, each one a 2D machine of which crucial parts are missing. The player's task is to choose useful objects from a separate window, position them on the screen and start the machine to see if it’s working. A simple example: a piano hanging from a rope needs to be dropped on Al. To accomplish this, you place open scissors next to the cable and drop a ball on them - voila, the rope is cut, Al crushed. However, most puzzles are far more complicated; for example, the player might first have to lure Al under the piano with a fish, which needs to be transported to the right location by conveyor belts. \n \nThe puzzles involve a score of contraptions, ranging from simple ropes and pulleys to balloons, trapdoors, catapults, bombs, electrical hairdryers, and motors. Sid and Al are accompanied by several other cartoon characters, such as the lady elephant Eunice who will toss things around, or the pet dragon Bik that ignites objects with his fiery breath. \n \nGameplay is spiced up with cartoon animations -- Al chasing Sid is a sight to remember. If the player has solved all of the puzzles, the player can build own challenges with the comfortable editor. Oh, be sure to learn Sid & Al’s lessons well -- you never know when you need to get rid of a mouse with nothing but some cheese, a trapdoor and an anvil.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Dynamix, Inc."],"publishers":["Sierra On-Line"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":725846400,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1lwg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":191050,"name":"Sinister","summary":"You wake up inside a strange bunker.

Sirius' existence has been known for some time, as a physical prototype has been in hands of a collector for years, but this prototype was known to be unstable and crash frequently. The source code for Sirius was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware. Sirius is a horizontally oriented space shooter that will feel right at home to those familiar with games such as Gradius and R-Type. The game consists of four different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Sirius deftly demonstrates what the 7800 hardware is capable of and compares favorably with NES and Sega Master System games of the time. Unfortunately, Sirius is aggravatingly difficult and will require much practice and patience to succeed through all four levels. Sirius is a single player game only. The difficulty level (easy and hard) can be selected via the left difficulty switch. Sirius has several different types of weapons power-ups. The first is a \"ghost ship\" that follows you and fires when you fire. Other power-ups include rapid fire guns and rapid fire plus spread fire. You can pick up one extra of each power-up type for reserve so that when you are killed you won't be quite so vulnerable. There are also diamonds that you can pick up but they don't seem to do much other than reward you 300 points. A partially compiled version of Sirius was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Sirius was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Atari 7800"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7n1x.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":57821,"name":"Simple Character 2000 Series Vol.17: Sentou Mecha Xabungle - The Race in Action","summary":"A 2D racing and mecha combat game based on the Combat Mecha Xabungle anime series.","genres":["Racing"],"developers":["Bandai"],"publishers":["Bandai","D3 Publisher"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1049328000,"platforms":["PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rhwxt3zvknciqrwgcqjf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":181667,"name":"Sinful","summary":"You've been a good boy and have to start from nothing to become bad.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":101098,"name":"Sister Square's Escape","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":275714,"name":"Simon the Seahorse The Animated Adventure Game","summary":"Travel to 13 Locations around the world!

In this paradise managed by robots there is not any crime, taxes, unemployment, or freedom. The population lives in a domed \"megapolis,\" and perhaps due to the war that occurred during Return to Eden, there is not any contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of flying saucers keeps the population afraid from going outside. \n \nThe main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he awakens. It was only a simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available during the reign of the third Kim. This \"Garden of Eden as a prison\" allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers. \nDevelopment \n \nThe Worm in Paradise is the third and final instalment of the Silicon Dreams trilogy and is a departure from the previous games. It \"evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9's own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word vocabulary, a very highly-advanced English input, memory-enhancing text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated type-ahead, and multi-tasking so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn.\" This was the first game using version 3 of the A-Code system. It was released for four fewer platforms, excluding the Lynx, Memotech MTX, Nascom and Oric-1 compared to the two previous releases. \n \nAnother difference is that the player has only seven days, within the game's clock, to complete the game. Quests are also time-based and require that the player arrive at certain locations at specific hours to achieve the desired goal. And while game play remains the same, the backdrop is no longer an action adventure, but a political thriller that resembles the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Similar to what happened when Snowball was released, there was certain confusion about the main character's identity and the time when the story is set. The Level 9 Fact Sheet says: \"...a couple of years later, Kim Kimberley has become a legend on Eden.\" Another article stated: \"Worm in Paradise is set 100 years later. You are now Kim Kimberley III...\" Furthermore, Pete Austin said, \"Worm is set on Eden, about 50 years in the future\" and \"The player is not Kim - she becomes mayor and runs the place.\" Notice that these sources termed the game by its original name, Worm in Paradise.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":308540,"name":"Sidelined Futures","summary":"In an alternate Takumi-Verse, Miles Edgeworth's cushy, straight-A student life at Ivy U. is interrupted when a murder happens on campus.

Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. Enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.\n\nOnce the Sinistar is completely formed, a digitized voice makes various threatening pronouncements, including \"Beware, I live!,\" \"I hunger, coward!,\" \"I am Sinistar!,\" \"Run! Run! Run!,\" \"Beware, coward!\", \"I hunger!,\" \"Run, coward!,\" and a loud roaring sound. The Sinistar has no weapon attacks, but if it contacts the player's ship while it darts about the playfield, the player's ship will be \"eaten\" and destroyed. A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy a fully built Sinistar, although an incomplete Sinistar can be damaged to slow construction. Each short-range Sinibomb automatically targets the Sinistar when fired, but can be intercepted by a collision with an enemy ship, enemy fire, or a planetoid.\n\nThe player moves from one zone to the next each time he defeats the Sinistar. A sequence of four zones repeats continuously after the first zone. Each is named for the most numerous feature of that zone: Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone (the Void Zone is especially difficult because it has very few planetoids). Beginning with the first Worker Zone, a completed but damaged Sinistar can be repaired/rebuilt by the enemy ships by gathering more crystals, extending its \"lifespan\" if the player is unable to kill it quickly.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Williams Electronics"],"publishers":["Williams Electronics","AtariAge"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":412905600,"platforms":["Arcade","Atari 8-bit","Atari 5200"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6o3f.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":203018,"name":"Simple 1500 Series Vol. 34: The Quiz Bangumi","summary":"Simple 1500 Series vol. 34: The Quiz Bangumi is a quiz game that features 4 different themes and 12 different characters for the player to choose.

The game was followed by a PlayStation 2 sequel, a reimagining for the PlayStation 3 and a film adaption.\n\nSiren is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the \"Link Navigator\". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called \"Shibito\", or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.\n\nThere are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's player characters possess a psychic power named \"sightjack,\" which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non-player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they can recover after some time has passed. Characters will lose stamina during combat and while running.","genres":["Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["SCE Japan Studio","Project Siren"],"publishers":["Sony Interactive Entertainment","Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1068076800,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation 4","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p0m.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":264616,"name":"Simple Solitaire","summary":"Play the most basic and simple game of solitaire.

It also adds new colours and tweaks the movement to optimize it and make it more responsive. By completing the game two additional playable characters can be unlocked. Completing it once unlocks Zazelle and a second time Johnny Limite. They each have different moves providing different gameplay.\n\nThe crowdfunded version comes on a cartridge with a box and manual. The cartridges are numbered with a unique serial number. Based on the tier different extras were provided, such as having your name listed in the manual. There is also a tier with a blue cartridge limited to six copies.

For the first two instalments the player has the role of Kim Kimberly, an undercover agent, whose goal in Snowball is to save the colonist's spacecraft from crashing into a star, and in Return to Eden to stop the defence system at the destination planet of Eden from destroying the craft.

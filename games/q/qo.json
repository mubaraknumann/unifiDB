[{"igdb_id":263923,"name":"Qomp2","summary":"An artful reimagining of Pong, qomp2 picks up the story where the delightful indie platform-puzzler qomp left off in 2021.\n\nControl a Pong ball aching to break free of its life stuck between two paddles. Explore a dangerous, minimalist world, armed with simple two button controls: tap a button to change direction by 90 degrees, and hold down a button to unleash a cathartic dash forward. That’s all you need to solve environmental puzzles and labyrinthine levels. Around each corner is a new challenge that will test your two-button and problem-solving skills. A variety of difficult enemies and bosses help you mark your time as you navigate through 30 levels spread across four worlds.\n\nA cerebral puzzler lies within the heart of this indie twist on Pong.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Adventure","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["Graphite Lab"],"publishers":["Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":78.66666666666667,"release_date":1708387200,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co704f.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":113218,"name":"Qop 4","summary":"Qop 4 is a minimalistic puzzle which goal is to get the cube to finish using 4 directions in space.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["Quiet River"],"publishers":["Quiet River"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1545177600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3y66.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":76379,"name":"Qop 2","summary":"Qop 2 is a minimalistic puzzle which goal is to get the cube to finish using 4 directions in space.","genres":["Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Quiet River"],"publishers":["Quiet River"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1513036800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26yh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":102389,"name":"Qop 3","summary":"Qop is a minimalistic puzzle which goal is to get the cube to finish using 4 directions in space.","genres":["Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Quiet River"],"publishers":["Quiet River"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1528329600,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2962.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":142475,"name":"Qomp","summary":"You control the ball on its journey to freedom.\n\nIn qomp you use only a single button to defeat bosses, solve puzzles and overcome platforming challenges.\nAt the end of your journey lies freedom.\nOr does it?","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Stuffed Wombat"],"publishers":["Stuffed Wombat","Atari, Inc."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1612396800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7ryp.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":213181,"name":"Qorbit","summary":"Qorbit is an easy to play arcade puzzler with interesting game mechanics.\nUnlock cosmic objects which give you certain advantages in the game, collect points and start cosmic event and collect man-made space objects like the space shuttle!","genres":[],"developers":["Sirnic Games"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1488844800,"platforms":["Android"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co52qh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":171435,"name":"qop: DLC","summary":"In this DLC you get 12 new levels for qop.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":["Quiet River"],"publishers":["Quiet River"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1502150400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coabad.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":17492,"name":"Qora","summary":"A mysterious trip to gorgeous and surreal lands, players explore the unknown and harness mystical powers which have been hidden in the valley for centuries.","genres":["Music","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Ciprian Stanciu","Holden Boyles"],"publishers":["Curve Digital"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1409788800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3y67.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":308538,"name":"QotU","summary":"Two friends stand alone in an abandoned courthouse, wondering where everything went wrong.

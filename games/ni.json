The latter are either collectable power-ups or environmental objects like phone boots.\n\nThe player's ninja can attack his enemies using his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with five units.\n\nThe game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same five kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.\n\nA two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing the player's ninja chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Tecmo"],"publishers":["Atari Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["Atari Lynx"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4sz9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":325580,"name":"Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound","summary":"A brand-new side-scrolling entry to the NINJA GAIDEN series from the team behind Blasphemous, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound redefines the classic platformer saga in a spectacular, thrilling and challenging ninja adventure.","genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Indie","Arcade"],"developers":["The Game Kitchen"],"publishers":["DotEmu"],"aggregated_rating":86.0,"release_date":1753920000,"platforms":["Xbox Series X|S","PlayStation 4","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation 5","Xbox One","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9qrg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":248023,"name":"Nine-Tailed Okitsune Tale","summary":"Fluffy x Kawaii!

The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":["Kalisto Entertainment"],"publishers":["Activision","Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":875577600,"platforms":["Nintendo 64","PC (Microsoft Windows)","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5j7q.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":370983,"name":"Niman","summary":"Niman is a fast paced, 2D-Action Platformer with minimalist look and a gravity bending level design where you need skill and tenacity to get through","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Strange Nebula"],"publishers":["Strange Nebula"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coalep.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":371146,"name":"Ninja Gold Thief","summary":"Join the adventure and control a cute blue ninja on a gold-stealing spree.

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\n\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.\n\nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings, and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros. Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys and a series of Nintendogs trading cards. At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["Nintendo"],"publishers":["Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1114041600,"platforms":["Nintendo DS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6pnx.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":222501,"name":"Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection - Version D","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":118819,"name":"Nightmare","summary":"Have you ever wondered what is crawling around your bedroom?

It was inspired by an early 1980s game called Hustle from the Radio Shack TRS-80 micro-computer. (It was not influenced by Mozaik Software's 1984 Amstrad CPC game, Nibbler, despite the similar names.) Nibbles was written in QBasic by Rick Raddatz, who later went on to create small business companies such as Xiosoft and Bizpad.\n\nThe game's objective is to navigate a virtual snake (or worm) through a walled-space while consuming numbers (from 1 through 9) along the way. The player must avoid colliding with walls, other snakes or their own snake. Since the length of the snake increases with each number consumed, the game increases in difficulty over time. After the last number has been eaten, the player progresses to the next level, with more complex obstacles and increased speed. There is a multiplayer mode which allows a second player to control a second snake by using a different set of keys on the same keyboard.\n\nNibbles originally became popular because it was included with MS-DOS version 5.0 and above. Written in QBasic, it is one of the programs included as a demonstration of that programming language. The QBasic game uses the standard 80x25 text screen to emulate an 80x50 grid by making clever use of foreground and background colors, and the ANSI characters for full blocks and half-height blocks. Microsoft's 24kB QBasic version was copyrighted in 1990. Because of MS-DOS's prevalence at that time, it was available on almost every PC in the early 1990s. Modern computer speeds have rendered the game-speed-delay timing loops invalid, and thus the QBasic version of Nibbles requires some code changes to operate correctly on modern PCs. However, the adjustable clock rate on the DOSBox DOS emulator allows the original code to run at speeds similar to those on the original hardware. Nibbles is also runnable on QB64 as a way to avoid emulation.","genres":["Arcade"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Microsoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":694137600,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjbthx3xqtctmtcbsuuj.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":98285,"name":"Nightruth: Futatsu Dake no Shinjitsu","summary":"\"Futatsu Dake no Shinjitsu\" (\"The Only Two Truths\") is the third and final game in the Nightruth series, this time starring the youngest of Shinya's classmates, Ai Himekawa.

Like the original version, the player's movements and combat system are directed using the console gamepad, which comprises the left thumbstick, two attack buttons, and a block button. The game features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. A new addition to Ryu's arsenal is a pair of dual-wield swords, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang. It also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ninpo, which allows him to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself. By shaking the Sixaxis controller, players are able to increase the power of their ninpo spells. Rachel, a non-playable character in the 2004 game, became playable in three new chapters, featuring the new bosses, Gamov and Alterator. Some of the design elements of the old levels was also changed and several new enemy types were introduced.\n\nIn addition to the narrative Story Mode, Sigma included a gameplay variation called Mission Mode. Focused on action rather than character development, this provides combat-based missions set mainly in small areas. In both Story and Mission modes, game scoring is based on the player's speed in clearing encounters, the number of kills achieved, the number of unused ninpos remaining at the end, and the amount of cash collected. Players can compare their scores on online ranking boards. In addition, players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.","genres":["Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1186099200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4051.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":45254,"name":"Ninku Gaiden: Hiroyuki Daikatsugeki","summary":"Ninkuu Gaiden: Hiroyuki Daikatsugeki (忍空外伝 － ヒロユキ大活劇) is a Sega Game Gear top-down action game based on the Ninkuu franchise.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":817948800,"platforms":["Sega Game Gear"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6yn6.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":82630,"name":"Ninja Girl Ayame","summary":"A role-playing game from housegame.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k8pvtrygcgdnrvkyad7y.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":64935,"name":"Nikoli no Puzzle V: Hitori ni Shitekure","summary":"All 50 questions recorded are handmade by Nikoli's puzzle writer, so the feeling of solving is different!\nIn addition, the operation unique to PlayStationVita makes it easier to play with problems with large board sizes!\nFrom beginners to advanced players, please enjoy the deep world of puzzles.","genres":["Puzzle"],"developers":["Nikoli Co."],"publishers":["HAMSTER"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1342656000,"platforms":["PlayStation Vita"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co47le.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":66135,"name":"Ninety-Nine Nights Online","summary":"Ninety-Nine Nights Online is Q Entertainment's take on the MMO genre.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uydghupnodtpgggrzkzt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":322006,"name":"Nightmare's Revenge","summary":null,"genres":["Arcade"],"developers":["Q-Nova"],"publishers":["Q-Nova"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1432684800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":35502,"name":"Nightfall: Escape","summary":"Nightfall: Escape puts you in the shoes of a field journalist who is on a mission to investigate the mysterious disappearances in a remote area.

Enemies use various projectiles, one of which will cause the player to lose a life. If JaJaMaru-kun lands on top of an enemy, it will simply be temporarily stunned and vice versa. Once an enemy is defeated and offscreen, a spirit will appear and ascend to the top of the screen. It can be collected before it has disappeared to receive points, which vary depending on the enemy. Sakura will sometimes drop petals that the player can collect, and Damazu will sometimes run around, dropping bombs.

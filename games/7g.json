[{"igdb_id":16537,"name":"7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat","summary":"What Ancients Begat is a complete (~15 hour) game of family generations surviving the rise of western civilization. Survival is the ultimate goal. The sub-goals, you choose, build their story.\n\nExperience an abstract telling of the lives of our earliest recorded ancestors. Part board game, part machine, part nod to computer games of yore, it begins with a simple mechanic. Spend tokens to traverse the wheel of life. Earn tokens by tempting the jaws of death. Then, like layers upon a pearl, game play expands, introducing fresh tactics and strategies which, turn by turn, drive a sophisticated, emergent narrative. How you play defines the lives of one family's generations through the changing ages.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Quiz/Trivia","Indie"],"developers":["Mousechief"],"publishers":["Mousechief"],"aggregated_rating":40.0,"release_date":1367712000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2pcw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":345137,"name":"7 Gunfighters","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":52351,"name":"7 Gates: The Path to Zamolxes","summary":null,"genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Nebuloasa"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1330992000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7zfk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":160238,"name":"7 Girls War","summary":"A legend passed down for generations says when the world is in peril, seven legendary heroes will come together to face evil and save the world.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Kagura Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1630108800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co45r4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":295780,"name":"7Groves","summary":"A game in which you explore surreal and beautiful forests.","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1717113600,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coade9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146068,"name":"7 Grand Dad","summary":"7 Grand Dad is a Chinese bootleg game, which is a ROM hack of The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino and Hoppy.

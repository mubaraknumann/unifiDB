The player takes control of a young soldier equipped with magical wings who must save the world from a malfunctioning supercomputer.\nLegendary Wings is set in a distant future where an alien supercomputer named \"Dark\", which has been helping human civilization achieve a new state of enlightenment since ancient times, has suddenly rebelled against mankind. Two young warriors are given the Wings of Love and Courage by the God of War Ares in order to destroy Dark and ensure mankind's survival.\nThe coin-op version of Legendary Wings can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with a second player being allowed to join the game at any time or even continue after a game over. The game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons which changes depending on the context. The game consists of five areas with two different playing styles: the first segment in each stage is a top-view vertical scrolling segment in which the player flies across the sky, shooting at airborne enemies with their gun while dropping bombs at ground enemies, in order to reach the palace at the end of segment. When the player defeats the guardian and gains entrance to the palace, the game switches to a side-scrolling perspective, in which the player moves towards their goal on foot (by walking, crouching, and climbing ladders, as well jumping) until reaching the boss at the end, in which the player character will begin to fly with their wings again. In addition to the regular levels there are two optional levels that are accessible from the vertical-scrolling segment: a trap level in which the player is forced to escape from if they're sucked by the giant mechanical face on each area; and a hidden bonus level where the player can obtain various treasure chests to increase their score.","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Arcade"],"developers":["Capcom"],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":533779200,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qvi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":322889,"name":"Leucanthemum Eyes","summary":"On a rainy day, Daisy went through a tunnel to wait out the rain.\nSuddenly she found herself in a place that looked like a sewer, but hellish.\nDaisy needs to escape from that place full of ghosts and a beautiful mysterious women.","genres":["Point-and-click","Adventure","Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["Kuraishimi"],"publishers":["Kuraishimi"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1732924800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co94hw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":253026,"name":"Let's Sing 2019: Hits Français et Internationaux","summary":"Whether you like to vocalize alone at home or prefer to sing with friends and family, Let's Sing 2019: French and International Hits is made for you, with its brand new game modes and many features.

Charlie Kellner ported the game to the Apple II platform in February 1979. Throughout the 1980s Apple Computer included Lemonade Stand (along with other software) with the purchase of their systems.\n\nThe game simulates a child's lemonade stand, where choices made by the player regarding prices, advertising, etc. will determine the success or failure of the enterprise. The game owed its success to offering just enough variables to make a complex challenge for users, but still providing a simply-grasped addictive introduction to the offsetting priorities facing a business. The choice of the right prices and quantities on the day of a heat-wave could instill the satisfaction unique to a greatly profitable private enterprise.\n\nThe player is first given a weather report for the day (sunny, cloudy or hot and dry, each accompanied by a color drawing) and is prompted for three values: the number of glasses of lemonade to make, the number of advertising signs, and the cost of lemonade per glass. The program then gives a report of the earnings for that day. A thunderstorm, sometimes occurring on cloudy days and accompanied by a color animation, will void any profits and cause the player to lose any investment for the day. The game can be played either single-player or with up to 30 players (each player is independent and the sales of one do not affect another). The Apple II version included music, with bars from \"Morning Mood,\" \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,\" and \"Summertime\" played at appropriate moments.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":["MECC"],"publishers":["MECC"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":126144000,"platforms":["Microcomputer","CDC Cyber 70","Apple II"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6zdo.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":309209,"name":"Left 4 Dead 2: Alien Trilogy","summary":"A custom campaign for Left 4 Dead 2 based on the video game Alien Trilogy.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1319155200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8jf5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":322467,"name":"L'entraînement des Guerriers","summary":"In this immersive strategy game, you take command of an army in the prehistoric era, facing endless waves of increasingly powerful and determined enemies. Starting with modest resources, your mission is to lead your forces through the ages of prehistory, upgrading your base, developing your troops, and mastering skills and technologies tailored to this primitive world. With each level, the challenges grow tougher, as enemies become more resilient and strategic, making every battle more intense and harder to survive. You’ll need to adapt your strategy, strengthen your defenses, and recruit increasingly powerful units to stay ahead.\n\nContinuous improvement of your camp lies at the heart of the experience. After each battle, you earn science points, a valuable resource that allows you to unlock powerful upgrades. Using these points, you can reinforce your base fortifications, increase your warriors' strength, and unlock new abilities that will turn the tide in upcoming battles. Whether you choose to build an impenetrable defense, train a formidable army, or explore advanced prehistoric technologies, every decision will impact your future combats.\n\nFor a more personal touch, you can also customize your units and army with unique skins. These customization options add originality to your playstyle and allow you to forge an army that reflects your vision.\n\nThe ultimate challenge is to progress through the levels and overcome the ever-more fearsome waves of prehistoric enemies. As you advance, you’ll unlock new units, from basic warriors to mighty champions, each with unique skills to turn the tide of battle. The enemy waves will grow stronger without relent, but with each level, you’ll gain the tools and knowledge needed to overcome them and lead your army to victory.\n\nAnd the best part? The game is completely free. Everything is accessible without ever needing to pull out your credit card, thanks to a fair ad-supported system that fuels your progression.","genres":["Strategy","Tactical","Indie"],"developers":["Eragone"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1731196800,"platforms":["Android"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co91yf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":290599,"name":"Legend of Sword","summary":"This is a 3D Idle ARPG .

A free, limited version is available for online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online. The goal of Lemonade Tycoon is to sell lemonade for profit.\n\nWhile selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. Lemonade Tycoon employs a concept called \"Game-On\" which allows users to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue.\n\nWhile Lemonade Tycoon is compatible with multiple platforms, the game differs slightly on each. The Windows version allows more details and info because of a larger screen. Locations had a much bigger view and other versions had to deal with a smaller screen. They did not include as much information as the PC. Areas would be cut down so only a portion could be seen. Each platform, however, is not limited in usability and functionality. Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition is also available on Mac OS X, published by MacPlay.\n\nThe last update (1.1.9) was called Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe because it included some new levels and a slightly better UI. In 2009 Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of Lemonade Tycoon.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nGame Modes\nLemonade Tycoon includes three game modes; Career, Challenge and Champion. Career mode lets the player have a stand for as long as they want. Challenge mode had a 30-day limit to see how fast your stand can grow within the period of time.\n\nStocks/Supplies\nIn order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.\n\nSales and Advertisement\nThe player has the option to advertise in Lemonade Tycoon. Every day, the player can pay an advertising fee with different choices in advertising being available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.\n\nUpgrades\nLemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at different prices. Some reduce wait times, some improve visibility, some make ice, etc. Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity. There are also employees, a cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.\n\nLocations\nThere are five different locations where one can move your stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each location has a different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity. Popularity changes as the player's stand gets more popular. Good satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures that customers will come back to the stand. If there are short lines, there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player's customer satisfaction will go up. With the increase of satisfaction, customers will come back to a player's stand. Satisfaction and popularity are location based. They do not travel with you as you move from location to location.\n\nGame Factors\nThere are many News Headlines that change how well lemonade is sold. Some headlines can improve your business and some that can hurt your business. Headlines change every game day and can sometimes only affect a single location. Weather affects how well lemonade is sold as well. Warm and hot days bring more customers to stand than on cold, rainy days. The weather changes each day and does not seem to follow predictable patterns.\n\nLemonade Stock Exchange (LSX)\nThe Lemonade Stock Exchange was an online feature that let one see how one's stand compared to others.\n\nRECEPTION:\n\nAwards\nBest Pocket PC Strategy Game (2002 Pocket PC Magazine's Best Products Awards)\nApplied uses\nLearning Planet, an educational website, created the original version of the game for teaching economics and resource management for its students. The LearningPlanet.com version of Lemonade Tycoon is visually different but functionally identical to the other iterations of the game.","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":["JAMDAT Mobile","Hexacto"],"publishers":["Airborne","MacPlay","EA Mobile","Brøderbund Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1021334400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS","Mac","Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2n39.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":193748,"name":"Letters: Collector's Edition","summary":null,"genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4k0i.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":195199,"name":"Left Stranded","summary":"Left Stranded is a factory and a base building game set in a 2D procedurally generated world.You are a scientist sent to an unknown planet to harvest resources, build production lines and setup the foundation for further colonization.","genres":["Simulator","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5isi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":240091,"name":"Lemmings","summary":"This port features the same game on the surface, but both the graphics and sounds have been redone from scratch for this console.

Survival depends on you, your magic and your sword.\nWhat sets Legends of Dawn apart, is the freedom of play expressed in several key attributes that are rarely seen in typical RPG genres. We have poured our passion and creativity into taking you on an enthralling ride away from wearisome reality, by providing you with the choice to be whatever your heart desires, in Legends of Dawn.\n\nOf course, the choices you make during game play does not prevent you from trying something else later, or simultaneously if you wish. You could combine the sword and the magic, be a powerful crafter or anything else. Legends of Dawn liberates from class restrictions unlike real life. Class, race and differences exist within the game but after choosing your own race and gender, all else can be altered without restarting the game.\n\nAnother quality that makes Legends of Dawn interesting, is the freedom of direction and movement. Most games force a player to follow the main storyline and forbid any deviation, or significant veering off the set course. Legends of Dawn is more sympathetic to your playing needs. You are free to wander wherever tickles your fancy within the continent, without limitations, under one condition. Stay alive. We have been careful to ensure that the quests only suggest, rather than impose direction of movement. Your journey is in your hands alone.\n\nIn addition to all those remarkable features already mentioned, you are bound to notice another cool thing about Legends of Dawn. The absence of loading screen. It would have been so much easier to create a game that would constantly force you to wait before the screen while new contents load, but Dreamatrix is aware that your time is too valuable to waste. We put our heads together and created our very own engine that discreetly streams content in the background, in real time. You are free to enter houses, caves, dungeons, temples, new regions and so much more, without those pesky loading screens interrupting your playing pleasure.\n\nIn order to provide you with such blissful range of possibilities, we had to create a rather large world called Narr. The world of Narr in Legends of Dawn, spans across continents through stunning picturesque landscape that stimulates the mind. There are magical regions where the mountains and hills defy gravity, buoyant as balloons. We have also created countless dungeons awaiting for you to discover what mysteries lie within their cold depths, as well as camps, impressive docks and grim fortresses that bear silent witness to battles. Mausoleums and cemeteries also await your exploration. The hikes over unforgiving mountains and canyons are sure to thrill the most ardent explorer. Graceful flying islands and mystical swamps instil a sense of awe that could nudge you to cross the threshold of the serene temples and shrines to pay your respects to the gods of the land. With so much more on offer than is mentioned here, there is no reason why Legends of Dawn should not become your favourite RPG.","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Dreamatrix Game Studios"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1372291200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2isb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":192043,"name":"Let it Roll 2","summary":"Let it roll has a simple goal.

The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008.\n\nSet during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value.\n\nLeft 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009.\n\nThe popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Valve"],"publishers":["Valve"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1244764800,"platforms":["Xbox 360"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co72na.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":224161,"name":"League of Empires","summary":"League of Empires is the first ever true MMORTS game on blockchain.

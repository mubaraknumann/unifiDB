Most Talans populating the world can be conversed with about a variety of topics. A large portion of the game consists of finding key characters and performing quests for them; some of these are optional, though most must be completed in an adventure-like linear fashion in order to advance the plot. Cutter is free to travel between the continents using special portals.\n\nApart from exploration and completing quests, Cutter will also fight many guards and creatures. At his disposal are six futuristic weapons (railgun and others); ammunition for those guns is scattered around and can also be produced by mixing items. Aiming help is provided in the form of laser sights. Sneaking up to the enemy and punching him out silently is also possible. Gadgets such as a holo-decoy can be used to help Cutter gain the upper hand in combat. The player character can also jump, climb, swim, dive, crawl, and ride a local animal known as Twon-Ha for faster travel.","genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Appeal Studios","Fresh3D"],"publishers":["Infogrames","Fresh3D"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":930268800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20ge.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":3,"store":null,"uid":"2674","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-2674/"}]},{"igdb_id":149337,"name":"Our America","summary":"Our America is a branching VR narrative experience that follows a Black father and his son on their way to school.","genres":["Simulator"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3qpa.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":257358,"name":"Out of Fuel","summary":"Out of Fuel is an exciting and challenging game that puts you in control of a powerful chainsaw as you work to completely destroy various objects.","genres":["Simulator","Sport","Strategy","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6spi.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":190989,"name":"Ouija Rumours","summary":"Oujia: Rumors provides a first-person thriller-horror survival experience taking in a haunted house.

Friendships can be forged and ancient rivalries re-emerge through your encounters with almost-human and less-human races. Will you be able to distinguish friend from foe?\nAs in the original game, a single human is unable to face the forces of the universe alone. Achieve your goals by exercising diplomacy when needed, and seizing opportunities when they present themselves.\n\nWritten by FibreTigre, author of the original game, Out There Chronicles offers an epic story that will delight science fiction fans in search of new experiences.\nBrilliantly illustrated by top French SF artist, Benjamin Carré, and equipped with a simple interface, Out There Chronicles will take you on a journey of adventure, even if you’ve never played a video game before.\n\nFeatures :\n• 80 achievements\n• An interactive sci-fi graphic novel written by FibreTigre (Out There)\n• A complex dialogue system: your choices can have consequences later in the adventure\n• Master the alien language and discover their cultures\n• Stunning, varied environments\n• Develop relationships with an array of complex characters\n• Revelations on the Out There universe\n• A dead simple, accessible interface\n• Magnificent illustrations by Benjamin Carré, the French master of science fiction\n• Captivating music composed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn (Antichamber, Out There…)","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1467849600,"platforms":["iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pnmvyb8k4udv9m8qep4p.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":259394,"name":"Outer Base","summary":"This is a small map with a good design, stuffed with blood and gore.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1593820800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":199106,"name":"Our Ninja World","summary":"Take on our top-secret training games and transform into the ultimate ninja!

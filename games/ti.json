The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. \n \nIf this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. \n \nIn short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel.","genres":["Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Arcen Games","Arcen Games"],"publishers":["Headup Games","Arcen Games","Arcen Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1276646400,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ft0mkjr8nib6n45ay0ix.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":286132,"name":"Tilt","summary":"TILT is a first-person platform puzzle game set in an industrial-futuristic world of Ascendium Technologies, the sky is NOT the limit!

It was later ported for the PlayStation in 1997, bundled with the Guncon light gun controller.\n\nTime Crisis is a three-dimensional first person rail shooter similar to Virtua Cop and The House of the Dead installments, in which the player holds a light gun and goes through the motions of firing at on-screen enemies. Time Crisis is best known for its cover system, in which players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire and reload his weapon. There are three stages, each consisting of three areas and a boss battle. Unique features are described here in:\n\nA foot pedal which performs multiple functions: when the pedal is released, the player takes cover to conserve hit points while reloading the gun. While the pedal is released, the player cannot attack. In console conversions, a button command replicates the foot pedal's functions. The player loses a life if he/she is hit by a direct bullet or obstacle whilst not taking cover, with the game ending if he/she loses all lives.\nA light gun (introduced in Point Blank) which utilized a special memory chip to synchronize areas of the screen's image as the player rotates the gun around. The light gun also features a blowback function which simulates real-life gun recoil.\nA countdown timer, recharged by clearing an area of enemies. As running down the clock causes an instant game over, the player must take risks, shooting enemies rapidly and hiding only when necessary. A time extension is rewarded when an area is passed and there are also time bonuses awarded for shooting certain enemies quickly.\nThe PlayStation port features an exclusive side-story mode, in which the player's performance, such as how quickly he can clear an area, affects the path he takes through the game, resulting in multiple possibilities.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Namco"],"publishers":["Namco"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":817776000,"platforms":["Arcade","PlayStation"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1y7l.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":160612,"name":"Tiger Tank 59 I: Battleship MP049","summary":"Tiger Tank 59 Ⅰ: Battleship is a top-down shooting game.

However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.)

On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.","genres":["Simulator","Sport"],"developers":["EA Orlando"],"publishers":["EA Sports"],"aggregated_rating":75.66666666666667,"release_date":1188259200,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","Wii","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac","PlayStation Portable","Xbox 360","Nintendo DS","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co39uh.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":160797,"name":"Tiger Tank 59 I: Break the Fog MP058","summary":"Tiger Tank 59 Ⅰ: Break The Fog is a top-down shooting game.

The game retains the same basic gameplay mechanics from the series albeit with several new changes, most notably the addition of the \"Star\" symbol to the game's existing symbols of cross, circle, square, triangle and arrows. The \"Star\" symbol represents the \"Scratch\" move where instead of pressing the face buttons as usual, players rub the screen or flick the analogue stick, depending on which system is being used. \"Chance Time\" has been modified from previous installments, with each successful beat filling a star shaped gauge on the bottom left of the screen. When filled, it triggers a final scratch symbol that, if successfully scored, will change the outcome of the scene. Another new mechanic is the \"Technical Zone\" mechanic. When it occurs during a song, players must maintain an uninterrupted combo within that time limit for bonus points.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["Sega Corporation"],"publishers":["Sega Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":78.33333333333333,"release_date":1346284800,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation Vita"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4kws.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":356418,"name":"Hamtaro Card e: Gekijou Gentei - 03-A018: Ai-n-chan","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["e-Reader / Card-e Reader"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":261546,"name":"Hai Shuuraku Tansaku","summary":"The protagonist embarks on a journey to an abandoned village upon a friend's request...\nInvestigate what happened in the abandoned village in this first-person horror game.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1700179200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6xs5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":16542,"name":"Hate Plus","summary":"Let's spend the next three real-time days together uncovering the mystery of what went horribly wrong on a derelict generation ship, with the help of a spunky/more-than-slightly-traumatized AI sidekick!

The year is 1949, with the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union looming and both sides uneasy at the thought of an atomic war occurring. The player takes the role of a Soviet commando on an undercover mission to meet a contact in Allied-occupied Germany. However, things go badly for this meeting, leaving the protagonist without proper support, equipment, and identification papers. Behind Allied-occupied lines, the player must attempt to stop a rogue third party intent on initiating World War III between the US and Russia.\n\nPlayers can choose to start with one of 6 player classes: Soldier, Grenadier, Scout, Sniper, Medic, and Engineer. Additionally, there are opportunities throughout the game to recruit additional characters to round out the party's abilities. The game itself features a branching plot where the player's actions and dealings with NPC's can have serious consequences later on. For example, an intelligent character may be able to talk his way out of a situation, and killing Allied soldiers may prompt more patrols later on and slide the situation towards World War III.\n\nHammer & Sickle also features heavy squad-based combat, and it inherits the turn-based engine from Silent Storm. Players spend Action Points to perform various actions in battle each turn, while the enemy does the same. The engine also models realistic looking physics that feature ragdoll animations, bullet ricochet, and destructible environments. As for available equipment, there are 90 weapons and variants that can be found or bought.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":57.5,"release_date":1133740800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2x88.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":8800,"name":"Halfway","summary":"Halfway is a turn-based strategy RPG taking place a few hundred years into the future.

You are working with your scientist pals when one scientist working with a hazardous radiation meter detects high radiation amounts coming from all over. They radio into the Administrator's office, the office of Dr. Wallace Breen. Instead of Breen answering, they pick up a remote conversation between Breen and an unknown voice. \"It's done,\" Breen said. \"The Xenian crystal triggered a dimensional rift between Earth and the boarderworld Xen. Now let's get to the surface!\" \"I'm sure my employers will be pleased,\" says the unknown voice, and then silence fills the room followed by an explosion. The other scientists are amazed that the Administrator of Black Mesa himself would work with someone to trigger such a disaster and are trying to turn Breen in to the Special Projects Executive, the overseers of the Black Mesa Research Facility. The only way to get the S.P.E. to believe them is to get Dr. Breen's special operations profile from his office and hand it over to the S.P.E. as evidence. The scientists, however, are terrified of entering Black Mesa after a resonance cascade saying it is too dangerous. Gordon Freeman volunteers to go into Black Mesa, retrieve Breen's Administrative profile and bring him to justice.\n\nThis MOD suggests that Gina Cross was the one to push the xenian crystal into the anti-mass spectrometer and Gordon was not near Sector C at the time. Surface Lab A Security Complex is located on the surface of Sector D.\n\nThe scientists detect that Breen's Administrative profile is located in the Lambda Complex so your goal as Gordon Freeman is to get the Lambda Complex and retrieve Breen's profile and make it back to Surface Lab A alive.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1254268800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6g3j.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":6738,"name":"Half-Life: Decay","summary":"Half-Life: Decay is an expansion pack for Valve Software's science fiction, first-person shooter video game Half-Life.

Before long, Anri loses control of her magic and it is flown outside, almost falling onto Yuuma and his friends. Ultimately, Haruhi gives him the chocolate she had bought, and in turn Anri does the same, which was her plan - to give her chocolate to the same boy as Haruhi and see who would win his favor more.

The player takes the role of an ambitious citizen who wants to become the mayor of Lübeck.

This means the current salt price is the most important part when planning shipments (besides the weather). Of course the player also has to purchase and maintain other things, e.g. a trading station, ships and cannons. Alternatively the player can also participate in smuggling.","genres":["Strategy","Tactical"],"developers":[],"publishers":["arioloasoft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536371200,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX","Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga","Amstrad CPC","Sega Master System/Mark III"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8iv4.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":146546,"name":"Hawk Kawasaki Racing","summary":"For many years Kawasaki has been a world leader in producing world class motorcycles.

It closely resembles its predecessor in terms of gameplay and mechanics. One notable feature of this game is the inclusion of the Augusta National golf course, which is officially licensed by the Augusta National Golf Club. When playing the game, you view your golfer from a third-person perspective, with a mini-map of the current hole displayed on the right side of the screen. The main menu offers various modes to choose from, such as Masters, Tournament, Stroke Play, Match, and Training. The movement of the ball is influenced by the type of terrain and the point of impact between the club and the ball during your swing. The direction of your shot is affected by the wind, and the game also includes weather effects like rain.","genres":["Sport"],"developers":["T&E Soft"],"publishers":["T&E Soft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":748656000,"platforms":["PC-9800 Series","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kxonkqhfharbzkf6cixw.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":42068,"name":"Hanii on the Road","summary":"Hanii on the Road (aka Hany on the Road or Honey on the Road) is a side scrolling action game by Face. After Hanii's exploits in Hanii in the Sky, the little Haniwa clay doll is back on a new mission. This time around, our cute friend must free the world from all the demons and other evil creatures that escaped from the Gods' realm. But this time around he's not flying or shooting balls of energy - instead, he must run along a roadway divided into four lanes, each moving at different speeds. And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!). Hanii on the Road consists of many levels and features a non-linear structure with interconnected paths to follow, as well as bosses. The game also offers a two simultaneous player mode where Lemon, a yellow version of Hanii, comes to the rescue.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["Arc System Works"],"publishers":["FACE"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":652665600,"platforms":["TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6fgv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":142926,"name":"Hazordhu","summary":"Delve into the low-fantasy medieval lands of Hazordhu, where you will explore a vast open world full of dangers and wonders where every building and every item is player-made, and the online world changes based on your actions.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1702684800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2pcf.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":293335,"name":"Hauntsville","summary":"You're a nameless traveler, stranded in a ghost town in the Cursed West.

Vol. 1: Rebirth","summary":".Hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game; players assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area.

A year consists of four seasons, each of which lasts 30 days. Different crops can be planted each season, but before the seeds can be planted, the land must be cleared and then the soil tilled.\n\nSeeds must also be watered until the fruit or vegetable matures. Once the crops are ready for harvest, they can be placed in a shipping bin where they'll be collected and paid for. In addition to farming, players will interact with local villagers and partake in seasonal events such as the Tomato Festival and Fireworks Display. As more money is earned, players can expand their farm and begin to raise livestock such as chickens and cows.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator"],"developers":["Victor Interactive Software"],"publishers":["Natsume Inc.","Marvelous","Victor Interactive Software","Sony Computer Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":945302400,"platforms":["PlayStation 3","PlayStation","PlayStation Portable"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ubz.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":29156,"name":"Haunted: Halloween '86 - The Curse of Possum Hollow","summary":"A brand new NES homebrew game independently developed by Retrotainment Games and released on an NES cartridge.

It is incredible how many elements from other games are squeezed into a surprisingly fun melange platformer. Hard Head (and his twin in 2-player mode) carries a bubble gun that encloses enemies into bubbles, which can then be used as trampoline, just like in Bubble Bobble. Similar to Super Mario Bros, items are gained from blocks by jumping at them with the hero's head, while enemies are defeated by stepping on theirs. Then there's passages where one has to break through walls by using a hammer, which is very reminiscent of Wrecking Crew. \n \nHowever, other than with contemporary titles of home entertainment companies like Clover and Zemina, the designer (who sadly isn't credited at all) had also a few quite unique ideas, like working musical instruments used as platforms, a football that can be found in every stage and kicked through a goal at the level end for extra points. There even is a day/night change hinted at through pallette rotation of the mostly monocoloured background. The game has a time limit, but rather than just killing the player off when it runs out, more and more evil suns come attacking the player already when only little time is left. \n \nThe game can be enjoyed by two players simultaneously, who can use each other's head as a springboard to reach higher places without relying on nearby enemies. Only in the second half the game tends to get a bit tedious, as there's almost no new elements introduced after the middle, and those from the early stages grow old fast because of their steady repetition. Less interesting is also the music, which is mostly snatched together from various classical pieces.","genres":["Platform"],"developers":["SunA Co."],"publishers":["SunA Co."],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":570672000,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":314491,"name":"Hatch","summary":"Eat up all the food which falls from the sky one after the other.

There is a limit to what you can carry, forcing you to leave valuable items behind. The gold and gems you carry when you die increases your score, but it is heavy too.\n\nThe player must enter Hell to recover the Amulet. Entering Hell for the uninitiated just means that \"you burn to a crisp\". (In NetHack, Hell is renamed.)\n\nThe player encounters special rooms such as shops, crypts, and vaults. Other spatial elements in the game are traps and swamps. As your experience grows, so are your abilities, score and the need for food.\n\nRetrieving the Amulet doesn't guarantee you the high score. After all the Amulet is just a very valuable gem.","genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Jay Fenlason"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":443145600,"platforms":["DOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co70d5.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"18358","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-18358/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"16827","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hack"}]},{"igdb_id":12466,"name":"HardBall III","summary":"The third game in the Hardball baseball series.

Access can be gained if the player knows the password, which really only ever becomes apparent to the player after gaining access, through another means of entry, to the later stage of the game. Typing help or h in the command line would give a clue as to what the valid password is. Since initial attempts at entry would consist of guessing (and likely failing) access would eventually be granted to the player due a malfunction in the security system, thus allowing the player entry. Once admittance has been made, the player is then asked to identify various parts of a robot unit, by pointing the cursor at the relevant parts and pressing the fire button. Most parts of the unit have exotic and technical names, such as \"asynchronous data compactor\" or \"phlamson joint\" -- this again, allows for more room of error by initially trying to guessing which part each name belongs to. Failure to identify each part correctly and without any error, forces the player to take a retest until a 100 percent identification is made, at which point, the player is then allowed to continue.\nThe player guides this robot, as seen on the Apple II version of the game, through the extensive network of underground tunnels.\n\nThe player gains control of the robot which can travel around the globe via secret tunnels, deep within the earth. The game's text says the robot is powered in some manner by magma.\n\nBefore getting far, the player is informed that shredded portions of a secret document containing Magma, Ltd.'s plans for world domination have been stolen. The player is instructed to retrieve the document by bargaining with the spies who stole it, who are located at various locations throughout the globe. The player is warned it must be retrieved in order to prevent the US government from thwarting their plans. At this point, the player's objective is clear: retrieve the strips of the stolen document, but then deliver them to Washington DC.\n\nThe robot's tunnel system is extensive, but unmarked, so getting around is initially an exercise in trial and error. Throughout the globe, there are several cities where the robot can surface and interact with people, primarily the spies who want to bargain for their piece of the evidence.","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Adventure"],"developers":["Activision","Activision"],"publishers":["Activision","Pony Canyon"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":504835200,"platforms":["Atari 8-bit","PC-8800 Series","Commodore C64/128/MAX","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","Mac","DOS","Amiga","Apple II","Amstrad CPC","MSX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xyhqladopqoykm3nqhfy.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"20814","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-20814/"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"19013","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hacker"}]},{"igdb_id":259616,"name":"Hatsuyuki Sakura: White Graduation","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":95295,"name":"Happy Architect","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":71191,"name":"Harusame Youbi","summary":"Anime Dating RPG released in Japan","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":985219200,"platforms":["Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c7obtu3jewycvfzh3itg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":306569,"name":"Harold's Walk","summary":"Harold's Walk on Steam is a remaster of the original Harold's Walk game that debuted on the Nintendo 3ds in 2020.

They may be designed to burn with flames and sparks of many colors, typically red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, , silver and gold. Displays are common throughout the world and are the focal point of many cultural and religious celebrations.\n\nDuring the summer in Japan, fireworks festivals are held nearly every day someplace in the country, in total numbering more than 200 during August.

Released as a beta test on Quantum Link's online service, it allowed up to 500 players to simultaneously explore a vast, open-ended virtual world. Despite lacking traditional RPG elements like leveling or classes, Habitat broke new ground by offering a persistent, shared environment where players could interact through customizable avatars in a 2D, third-person perspective.\n\nThe game's emphasis on social interaction and player-driven content was revolutionary for its time. Players could engage in a wide range of activities, from simple communication and object manipulation to complex social endeavors like marriage, commerce, and even founding religions or guilds. The game world, comprised of thousands of diverse regions, encouraged exploration and discovery. Habitat's innovative features, including an in-game economy, player-run businesses, and global quests organized by the developers themselves, showcased the potential of virtual worlds as social platforms. This libertarian approach to gameplay, where players were limited only by the game's code, set a precedent for user-generated content and emergent gameplay in online worlds, influencing the development of future MMORPGs and virtual communities.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Lucasfilm Games"],"publishers":["Lucasfilm Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":536457600,"platforms":["Commodore C64/128/MAX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ili.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":204146,"name":"Hardenville","summary":"A 20-year-old guy studying at the Hardenville University, suddenly has important decisions ahead of him.

Vol. 3: Redemption","summary":".Hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption is the third entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["CyberConnect2"],"publishers":["Namco Bandai Games"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1169078400,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2vtd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":221016,"name":"Hakuoki Reimeiroku Portable","summary":"Port of Hakuoki Reimeiroku for the Playstation Portable.

Vol. 2: Reminisce","summary":".Hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce is the second entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["CyberConnect2"],"publishers":["Namco Bandai Games","Bandai"],"aggregated_rating":55.0,"release_date":1159401600,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2vtc.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":177210,"name":"Handsome Roadkill","summary":null,"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":274650,"name":"Hajimete no Eigo: Typing & Puzzle Keyboard Hairetsu mo Manaberu Youji-muke Gakushuu Benkyou Game","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":277092,"name":"Hatchepsout: The Hell Temple","summary":"Small to medium Egyptian temple","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1084406400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7drb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":79330,"name":"Hayarigami 2: Keishichou Kaii Jiken File","summary":"The second in Nippon Ichi's urban legend themed visual novels, continues the young police detective's investigations into mysterious and gruesome incidents.","genres":["Visual Novel"],"developers":["Nippon Ichi Software"],"publishers":["Nippon Ichi Software"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1195084800,"platforms":["PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zjm.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":313898,"name":"Habilis","summary":"Follow Nathan Walters as he quickly descends into insanity.

He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign.\n\nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration.\n\nHaven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Puzzle","Racing","Adventure"],"developers":["Traveller's Tales"],"publishers":["Midway Games"],"aggregated_rating":70.0,"release_date":1037577600,"platforms":["Xbox","Nintendo GameCube","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ovt.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":265837,"name":"Hansel and Gretel: Interactive Book","summary":"Hansel and Gretel.

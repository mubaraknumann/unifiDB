The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below. The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below. One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below. The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you'll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.","genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"developers":["Amuze"],"publishers":["Sega Europe","Sega of America"],"aggregated_rating":50.0,"release_date":1093564800,"platforms":["Xbox","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ovv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":251822,"name":"Heretic’s Fork: Probation","summary":"Dear candidate, start your free probation period as manager of Hell!

And a significantly expanded upgrade system gives you new options to promote officers, assign governors and construct buildings to specialize your units and cities. Plus, new improvements to Hegemony's celebrated logistics model makes managing your supplies more intuitive and more important than ever.\n\nHegemony Rome brings the past to life as you manage your armies and manipulate your enemies in a beautifully drawn simulation of 1st century BC warfare.

The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream.\n\nThe gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured. The game's writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a storyline where the hero encounters the Greek gods while trying to discover his own true identity. Like the game's predecessor, Heracles no Eikō II: Titan no Metsubō, the game focuses on its rich storyline rather than the game system, which does not differ significantly from other role-playing video games of the period.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Data East"],"publishers":["Data East","Paon","Nintendo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":704073600,"platforms":["Wii","Wii U","Legacy Mobile Device","Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4cap.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":362368,"name":"Hentai Photo: Kaneshon","summary":null,"genres":["Puzzle","Simulator","Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1755734400,"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":278231,"name":"Heaven Studio","summary":"Heaven Studio is a tool to create playable Rhythm Heaven custom remixes, with many customization options.\n\nThis title was delisted from GitHub and Itch.io per a DMCA takedown.","genres":["Music"],"developers":["RHeavenStudio"],"publishers":["RHeavenStudio"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1705276800,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7f2g.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":4495,"name":"Heavy Unit: Mega Drive Special","summary":"Heavy Unit: Mega Drive Special (ヘビーユニット メガドライブスペシャル) is a 1990 Sega Mega Drive shoot-'em-up developed by Kaneko and published by Toho exclusively in Japan.

Territories have a number of different levels of occupation, each providing a different quantity of cash once completed. Each territory also provides automatic income at regular intervals once it has been obtained.\n\nYellow territories are occupied by aliens and must first be cleared before they can be built upon. Each of these combat situations takes into account the player's attack and defense values and with each click, runs a combat simulation. If the player's health reaches 0, attack, defense, and recover are temporarily reduced to 0. The player must wait for these to return before attacking again. Once an enemy has been attacked, their health will regenerate over time.\n\nCash\nCash is rewarded each time an unoccupied territory is leveled up, and a smaller amount at regular intervals thereafter. Cash can be spent on buying upgrades that affect attack strength and defense level.\n\nLeveling\nThis is done automatically when the player collects enough XP. Once a level has been achieved, the player receives points that can be spent on attributes. The attributes are assigned at the right of the screen using the + buttons next to the three lines. The five available are Life, Attack, Defense, Recovery, and Cost.\n\nAction Points\nActions can only be performed when the player has enough points to spend on performing them. These can be seen in the purple bar on the right of the screen. Each action takes a number of points to perform, and these points are returned at a rate determined by the recovery score of the player.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Nekogames"],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1419984000,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6fh5.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":384706,"name":"Hentai Age Vacation","summary":"A calm, magical puzzle game where each completed stage reveals a beautiful portrait.

The only information that you have to go by is Primm’s unpublished paper on the legend of Ahnk-Ahnk and his African diary.\n\nThe quest begins near a large port town and here you can find stores which will allow you to purchase items which are necessary like ropes and shovels. You start the quest with only $250. Use the map provided to find important landmarks and locations which the natives may name when giving you directions. The natives hold the key to your success. Not all natives behave the same to strangers. Offer them gold, copper, or other gifts to win their friendship. But be careful, not all natives see your offering as a sign of friendship.

Presenting them with the wrong gift may hinder your attempts to get needed information.\n\nUse the joystick to move about, press the fire button when you are standing still to move control to the four icons to the left of the exploration window.

It was ported to the PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by Taito and was released on December 22, 1989. There was also a Mega Drive port by Toho entitled \"Heavy Unit: Mega Drive Special\" released on December 26, 1990. The player takes control of a star ship that can transform in to a mecha by obtaining a specific type of power up.\n\nSet in 2013, mankind's first artificial star and planet, \"Le Tau\", is under attack from genetically modified alien monsters. The player must navigate a \"Heavy Unit\", a heavily armed, transforming mecha, in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony.\n\nThe player's ship had two forms: a space-ship and a giant robot. Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. Power Ups are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss. Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread show with the power ups, plus missiles which drops like bombs as auxiliary fire.

[…] We had spent 15 months developing the title, and although many of us felt we achieved so much, it wasn’t enough to save the title.” \n \nThe developer's website described Hellgate as follows: \"Imagine a crossover between Quake and WipeOut. Got that image? Hellgate meshes these two genres, with high speed at your fingertips, as well as some meaty weaponry! There will be four gigantic realms to conquer, as well as ten formidable weapons to defeat the many demons and monsters lurking within Hell.\" \n \n\"We will also be supporting Dreamcast’s online capabilities with online Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Sumo and Time Trial modes, and also feature offline 4 player Deathmatch and link-up Deathmatch modes. The exciting thing is, Hellgate could well be the first Dreamcast game to support 12 – yes – 12 people.\" \n \nIn March 2009, a playable beta was leaked online.","genres":["Shooter"],"developers":["Horny Dog"],"publishers":["Jester Interactive"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":["Dreamcast"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xmk.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":222521,"name":"Henri","summary":null,"genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":null,"platforms":[],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":267351,"name":"Heir of Light Eclipse","summary":"Immerse yourself in an awe-inspiring realm where light and darkness wage a never-ending war...\n\nAccompany the enchanting girl, Nua, guarded by Goddess Ludmilla, in this breathtaking anime-style fantasy adventure!","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":["Com2uS"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1694131200,"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7jcd.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":195602,"name":"Hero Ring","summary":"\"Hero Ring\" is a 2D-platformer arena shooter in which you have to destroy the monsters that appear from the portals.

Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use.\n\nHero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories.\n\nThe main character's skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy's picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics.\n\nThe game features a day/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.","genres":["Point-and-click","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"developers":["Sierra On-Line","Sierra On-Line"],"publishers":["Sierra On-Line","Sierra On-Line"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":623203200,"platforms":["Atari ST/STE","DOS","Amiga"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8e8y.jpg","external_ids":[{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"18511","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hero's%20Quest:%20So%20You%20Want%20to%20Be%20a%20Hero"},{"category":null,"store":null,"uid":"20243","url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/games/3030-20243/"}]},{"igdb_id":141119,"name":"Heroes War: Counterattack","summary":"Here comes a perfect combination of turn-based RPG and Action!\nGet ready for war to save the world where the Z-virus wiped out and left only fear.\n\nRecruit mercenaries, collect equipment, and upgrade skills/abilities.

It has everything you love about RPG's – loot, levels and action. But instead of level grinding, you will rid the land of evil, one province at a time. To do this, you must combine your skill in combat with your ability to build a city capable of withstanding the enemy's assault and launching an attack on the enemy stronghold itself.\n\nGameplay consists of two main perspectives: FPS and city-building. There are dungeons to crawl and loot to procure, but the core gameplay comes during the city-building. As you rebuild the cities in each province, the enemy will not make it easy. You must construct your city so that it not only flourishes, but is well defended. Success requires not only a savvy mind for strategy, but skill with your crossbow to cut down the enemy before they reach your walls.\n\nYou will not be questing alone. As you travel throughout the land, you will rescue people who have been taken by the evil forces in the land. When you rescue them, they will be available to add to your party, or to reside in the main castle where their particular talents will aid your journey outside of combat. Fans of the Suikoden series will quickly recognize its influence on Heroes of Issachar.\n\nCombat\n\nThe action takes place as a first person shooter. Your signature weapon is a crossbow. Throughout the game, you will modify the crossbow, exchanging parts for new ones that confer a benefit to your skill and damage. In addition, there are mounting points for frost cannons, fireball launchers, magic shields, and many more add-ons. How you outfit your crossbow depends on you.\n\nIn addition to your crossbow, you will have a magic gauntlet that augments your skills. Different gems enhance different abilities, like speed, jumping, and even gliding. Other gems allow special skills like teleport and invisibility. Between the gauntlet and crossbow, you have the freedom to customize your combat in almost countless ways.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Strategy","Adventure","Indie"],"developers":["Blue Mana Entertainment"],"publishers":["Blue Mana Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1478131200,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":null,"external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":144382,"name":"Hello Charlotte: Heaven's Gate","summary":"You're hidden behind the lines.\nI reach out, deafened by silence.\nAs we mourn the Grasshopper's passing,\nHeaven's gate opens.","genres":["Indie","Visual Novel"],"developers":["etherane"],"publishers":["etherane"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1538092800,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2un8.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":266092,"name":"Helle's Undersea City Project: Bringing Air to The Garden","summary":"Grow and expand the land with air, aiming to rebuild the undersea city with a lone girl, Hele!

Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades. Improved weapons and grenade powerups are made available within the game, either in plain sight or within crates that must be unlocked using keys. Additionally, crates may contain orbs or one of the six pieces of the Heavy Barrel superweapon. Like SNK's Ikari Warriors, the original arcade version featured 8-way rotary joysticks.\nThe name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player's trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times). In a two-player game, whoever collects the sixth piece is equipped with the Heavy Barrel.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Data East"],"publishers":["Data East","G-MODE","Flying Tiger Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":539136000,"platforms":["Arcade","Zeebo","DOS","Apple II","Nintendo Entertainment System","Nintendo Switch"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fd1.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":307635,"name":"Hearthstorm","summary":null,"genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Nostra Games"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1721865600,"platforms":["PlayStation 4","PlayStation 5"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8g5v.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":8434,"name":"Heroes Chronicles: Masters of the Elements","summary":"Masters of the Elements is the third part of Heroes Chronicles, following Conquest of the Underworld and preceding Clash of the Dragons.\r\nTarnum becomes that which he hates most, a Wizard, in a hectic bid to assist the Wizards of Bracada in their quest to save the planet from the destructive Elemental Lords.","genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["New World Computing"],"publishers":["The 3DO Company"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":974246400,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29lv.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":235545,"name":"HeadAche: Visual Novel","summary":"Dima's obscure past keeps him busy.

In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.","genres":["Shooter","Racing","Adventure"],"developers":["Amuze"],"publishers":["Sega","Acclaim Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":90.0,"release_date":1005868800,"platforms":["Dreamcast","PlayStation 2"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co87sb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":322150,"name":"Hearthstone: Across the Timeways","summary":"Across the Timeways is Hearthstone's 31st expansion, featuring 145 new collectible cards released on November 4, 2025.

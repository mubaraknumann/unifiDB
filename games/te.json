The show's next season was held back to properly strategize the direction to take. TMNT 2003 had ultimately suffered from weak writing, making use of very involved plots but not comfortably telling the stories needed to be told, and as such the audience left. The decision was made to entirely skip the next season in favor of airing the semi-reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward, sending the brothers into the future and equiping themselves in cybernetic armor. Fast Forward had a distinctly different art style and the tone was much more lighthearted than before, though it failed to make any great impact on either ratings or merchandise due to the paper-thin premise. Only one game was produced to tie in with Fast Forward, Ninja Training NYC.\n\nNinja Training NYC is very much a standard action title for mobile phones, dumbing the concept down to make it suitable for a numberpad controller wihout any complicated controls. In this game, the TMNT must train in two specific categories, Combat and Agility.\n\nIn Combat, the turtle is situated center screen and must take out holographic men in suits wearing towels on their heads by pressing 4 or 6 repeatedly, or 2 in order to jump and attack. Certain enemies will drop special items which can be used to refill energy, and there is also a special meter that fills up; when full, it can be used to launch a shellshocker attack using the 5 key.\n\nIn Agility, the turtle of choice must run left or right to find the correct car which will fall down or find a hole to avoid getting killed off by the downward scrolling screen. The speed of the scrolling increases over time.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Overloaded"],"publishers":["Go Comics"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1167523200,"platforms":["Legacy Mobile Device"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7nnb.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":1240,"name":"Tekken Advance","summary":"Tekken Advance is a fighting game released for the Game Boy Advance.

The personal totals of each player were added to a mass tally, and with each day of the update a running total score for each side was displayed on the update page. The Soldier won with 6,406,065 total kills to the Demoman's 6,372,979, granting the Soldier the prize of an extra unlockable weapon, the Gunboats.\n\nThe second competition was the Propaganda Contest. Users were encouraged to design propaganda posters for the side of their choice, supporting either the BLU Soldier or RED Demoman. The posters were then submitted to Valve to be judged through the Propaganda Contest website.

Depending on the version of the game, the characters are either, chosen at the start of the game or assigned by control panel. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles' friend April O'Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed.\n\nThe eight-way joystick controls the movements of the Turtle, the jump button makes them jump and the attack button makes them hit in front of them using their weapon. In addition to this, some combinations are possible. The Turtles can throw Foot soldiers overhead, and by pressing the jump and attack buttons, a special attack is performed. Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a sweeping jump attack with their weapons. Turtles can also spring off the wall in certain areas. Enemies can be defeated more quickly by slamming them into walls or solid objects. Many objects such as traffic cones, parking meters, fire hydrants and exploding oil drums can be hit or damaged with attacks in order to help defeat nearby enemies. In the attract mode, the game showed the first part of the cartoon opening, along with a portion of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song.\n\nMost of the enemies the Turtles face are the Foot Soldiers, all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices.

It takes place on a three-dimensional surface, sometimes wrapped into a tube, which is viewed from one end and is divided into a dozen or more segments or lanes. The player controls a claw-shaped spaceship (named Blaster) that crawls along the near edge of the playfield, moving from segment to segment. Tempest was one of the first games to use Atari's Color-QuadraScan vector display technology. It was also the first game to allow the player to choose their starting level (a system Atari dubbed \"SkillStep\"). This feature increases the maximum starting level depending on the player's performance in the previous game, essentially allowing the player to continue.\n\nAn official port was released for the Atari ST. An official port that bears the Atari logo was released by Superior Software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron in 1985, and another by Electric Dreams for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1987. Versions for the Atari 2600 and 5200 were in the works in Atari, Inc. during 1984, and unfinished prototypes exist for both of them.","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"developers":["Atari"],"publishers":["Electric Dreams Software","Superior Software Ltd.","Atari","Atari Corporation"],"aggregated_rating":45.0,"release_date":370742400,"platforms":["Arcade","BBC Microcomputer System","ZX Spectrum","Atari ST/STE","Acorn Electron","Amstrad CPC"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6735.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":50541,"name":"Testbed Terror","summary":"Blast your way through an old-school single player campaign across three distinct realms!

The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day. After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled. Telepathy was actually developed as a demo to show what kind games the Mindlink could do. This \"demo\" is made up of seven different action screens held together by a loose \"mine\" theme. Thankfully Telepathy is playable without the Mindlink controller (unlike Bionic Breakthrough) by pressing the joystick button.

It was released in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple Macintosh. Terminus won awards in the 1999 Independent Games Festival for \"Technical Excellence\" and \"Innovation in Audio\".\n\nTerminus is outstanding in its implementation of Newtonian laws of motion, which means that objects are subject to inertia. Once accelerated, they float indefinitely into one direction, unless again accelerated into a different direction. This makes steering quite complicated, but mirrors actual behaviour in free space.\n\nIn Story mode, the player chooses one of four careers (United Earth League military, Mars Consortium militia, Marauder Pirate Clan, mercenary) and follows Terminus's single-player storyline, set in the year 2197. In 2000, Terminus was unusual among RPGs in that the player's actions can affect the ending of the storyline. Failing a mission, for example, may lead to a different ending than would have occurred if the mission had succeeded. One unique feature of Terminus is the story would progress with or without the player. The player could begin the game in story mode, then go off and do something else and the story missions/battles would still take place, reaching an outcome depending on which side eventually wins.","genres":["Simulator","Adventure"],"developers":["Vicarious Visions"],"publishers":["Vatical Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":962064000,"platforms":["Linux","PC (Microsoft Windows)","Mac"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9n7s.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":37790,"name":"Tenchi wo Kurau: Sangokushi Gunyuuden","summary":"Tenchi wo Kurau: Sangokushi Gunyuuden is a Strategy game, published by Capcom, which was released in Japan in 1995.","genres":["Strategy"],"developers":[],"publishers":["Capcom"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":808099200,"platforms":["Super Famicom"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5tte.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":172475,"name":"Test Subject Complete","summary":"The concluding part to the action puzzle platforming Test Subject series.","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Indie"],"developers":["Nitrome"],"publishers":["Nitrome"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1367884800,"platforms":["Web browser"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ddg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":149286,"name":"Technōs Arcade I","summary":"Compatible with both Handheld and VS models, the Technos Arcade I collection includes the following titles:\n\n- The Combatribes\n- Block Out\n- Battle Lane Vol. 5\n- Double Dragon II: The Revenge\n- Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone\n- Mania Challenge\n- Minky Monkey\n- Mysterious Stones: Dr John's Adventure","genres":["Fighting","Puzzle","Racing","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"developers":["Technos Japan","Arc System Works"],"publishers":["Blaze Entertainment"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1638921600,"platforms":["Evercade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4bfs.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":38658,"name":"Terra Battle 2","summary":"Upcomig game for android, PC and IOS.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"developers":["Mistwalker","Silicon Studio"],"publishers":["Mistwalker"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1505952000,"platforms":["Android","PC (Microsoft Windows)","iOS"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23e7.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":256680,"name":"Telly Wise","summary":"A strategy game where you manage you won T.V. station.\n\nYou buy or make programs, schedule them and get advertisers.","genres":[],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":662601600,"platforms":["ZX Spectrum"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6r8t.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":226606,"name":"Temple of Kasthet","summary":"Brian Teaser must escape from a mysterious Temple by solving mindblowing puzzles before they, well, blow his mind.","genres":["Indie"],"developers":[],"publishers":[],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1682640000,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co6rrg.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":245798,"name":"Teeny Dungeon","summary":"Traverse a teeny, yet infinite dungeon!

The higher the number of times the ball bounces on his side of the court before he returns it, the more damage is done to his health bar.\n\nYou can also collect & use power-ups that turn the ball into a bomb or a plasma weapon to hurt your opponent. Other power-ups available include ones that temporarily increase your running speed, give you the ability to steal a power-up from your opponent or give you a shield.\n\nFinally, if you hold down the swipe button long enough your character will launch a special attack at the other side of the court. However, while you're building up this attack you can't hit the ball.\n\nPlayers can refill their health bar by eating fruit & candy that appears on the court during gameplay. The first player to win the required number of rounds (1, 3, 5 or 7) wins the match.\n\nIn the single-player story-mode you start with only one character and collect 19 other characters by beating them in the 3 available episodes.

You are playing a member of a Teutonic city named Teudogar and your tribe is faced with the question whether to arrange a alliance with Rome or to unify the Teutonic tribes to fight them. \n \nThe main feature of this game is the historical accuracy. Every aspect of the game world is researched to align with the historical facts. There is even a whole encyclopedia included. Otherwise it is a RPG in the style of Ultima VII: You explore the world in a isometric perspective, talk to a lot of people and solve quests. You have a lot of freedom what to do and what not do do - you can explore the world or concentrate on the plot. \n \nCombat is complete turn based but if you are wounded your combat abilities start to decrease dramatically. The character system is based on \"learning by doing\" - if you use a certain weapon you get better in using it. There are no experiment points. The interface and the movement are completely mouse-controlled.","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"developers":["Wolf Mittag Software Development"],"publishers":["Wolf Mittag Software Development"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":1041379200,"platforms":["PC (Microsoft Windows)"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co217h.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":40002,"name":"Tecmo Knight","summary":"The protagonist Tecmo Knight has the assistance of \"Smokeman\" and \"Tiger\". Pressing the \"change\" button allows Tecmo Knight to switch between the two. Smokeman uses powerful punches and kicks against enemies while Tecmo Knight rides him. While riding the tiger, Tecmo Knight has the use of a spiked ball and chain less powerful than Smokeman's attacks, but with greater range. When collecting the special dragon skull that randomly appears after defeating an enemy, the Tecmo Knight will summon the most powerful creature to ride on in the game: the Flying Dragon. Tecmo Knight is immune to attack while riding Flying Dragon, whose breath kills any monster in the game instantly, including the stage-end bosses. Using the \"jump and attack\" maneuver, Tecmo Knight can bound Smokeman or the tiger onto enemies and pummel them.\n\nSometimes, if Tecmo Knight runs low on life, a blow by a weak monster will kill only Smokeman or the tiger, leaving Tecmo Knight to fend for himself with a very weak short-ranged attack. It is extremely hard for him to survive at this point. All bosses in the game appear in \"pairs\" making it harder for a single player to corner them. The only exception is the last boss. Currently, there are two \"extra life\" bonus skulls known to exist in the game. Players can also utilize \"props\" like bombs and stone-rollers placed around the map to their advantage.\n\nMuch like the 1988 arcade beat 'em up Ninja Gaiden, Tecmo Knight is hard for beginners, because it requires more patience than button-pounding. Like Ninja Gaiden, the game features a rather disturbing continue screen, where Tecmo Knight is about to be swallowed by an unseen monster. If the player does not continue before the 10 second countdown ends, Tecmo Knight is heard screaming as the monster swallows him. Afterwards, the screen will black out, and a monster will tear through the screen shouting \"NO FUTURE!\", along with \"Game Over\" appearing under the monster.","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"developers":["Tecmo"],"publishers":["Tecmo"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":631065600,"platforms":["Arcade"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co9qb9.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":45952,"name":"Tengai Makyou: Dennou Karakuri Kakutou-den","summary":"Tengai Makyou: Dennou Karakuri Kakutouden is a fighting game and the sixth game in the Tengai Makyou series.","genres":["Fighting"],"developers":["Red Company"],"publishers":["Hudson Soft"],"aggregated_rating":null,"release_date":806889600,"platforms":["PC-FX"],"cover_url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co72kl.jpg","external_ids":[]},{"igdb_id":251914,"name":"Telluria: Forebodings","summary":"A 3D graphic adventure with parallel realities, ancient vestiges and dark omens.
